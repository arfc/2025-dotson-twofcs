\section{Introduction}

%% General Background The general background should demarcate the overall
% scientific setting of your work. Start with a general topic that everyone in
% your audience cares about. Note that the general background should give your
% audience a sense of what to expect from your paper, not an overview of the
% history of a field. Introduce only necessary background that is related to
% your work, and make sure it can narrow down to your thesis.

%% Specific background: Work done so far Give your reader a sense of previous
% accomplishments, current contradictions, and competing theories in the field.
% Cite previous work that illustrates your narrative and gives a balanced
% description of the scientific landscape on this research topic.  

%%  Knowledge gap: Motivation for your work Give evidence of the incompleteness
% of the current understanding and of the value of investigating the field
% further. What is the gap that needs to be filled? Demonstrate the importance
% of this unsolved problem as the motivation for your work.  2

%% Aim of your paper Finally, clearly state the aim and scope of this article
% (not the project) and what exact question is answered. You may also briefly
% explain how the study was conducted, and share a preview of your findings.

Preventing the worst impacts of climate change will require our globalized
society to transition from fossil fuel infrastructure to clean energy
infrastructure. This transition must also be done equitably and justly to
prevent entrenching further injustices to marginalized and vulnerable
communities. An economy-wide transition presents a challenge unto itself due to
the spatial, temporal, and topological complexities of energy systems.
\textcolor{red}{\Glspl{esom}} are a class of tools designed to optimize this
transition used by energy planners and decision-makers to generate insights that
inform policy. However, \glspl{esom} are challenged by real-world optimization
challenges, which require simultaneous consideration of multiple competing
objectives.

Current \glspl{esom} exclusively optimize on cost, yet real world decisions are
also informed by non-financial priorities, such as sustainability and social
benefits. Since these objectives cannot be neatly captured by a cost metric,
ESOMs fail to optimize for these goals.  Rather than returning a single optimal
solution, multi-objective optimization generates a set of co-optimal solutions
called a \textit{Pareto front}, where no objective can be improved without
making another objective worse. The existence of a Pareto front evinces
tradeoffs which can only be resolved through dialogue in a participatory
process. 

A new multi-objective energy system optimization framework, \gls{osier} allows
users to optimize arbitrarily many objectives and define new objectives to
create a bespoke, contextualized, \textcolor{red}{model \cite{dotson_osier_2024}}. Since some
structural uncertainty will persist regardless of the number of objectives,
\texttt{Osier} leverages genetic algorithms for their ability to sample complex
Pareto fronts and because their search methods automatically sample sub-optimal
space. Further, \texttt{Osier} introduces a novel algorithm to calculate a
subset of maximally different solutions within the sub-optimal space to address
this uncertainty related to unmodeled objectives. By producing multiple
solutions, \texttt{Osier} gives modelers and decision-makers the tools to
meaningfully engage with public stakeholders and learn their preferences,
thereby attending to issues of procedural and recognition justice.

This work verifies \texttt{Osier}'s suitability for energy modeling problems
with two \textit{in silico} experiments. The first \textcolor{red}{experiment compares}
\texttt{Osier} to a more mature energy system optimization model,
\texttt{Temoa} \textcolor{red}{\cite{decarolis_using_2011}}, to verify that \texttt{Osier} produces results consistent with
known methods. In the second experiment, \texttt{Osier} reanalyzes a set of
nuclear fuel cycle options through the lens of Pareto optimality.
