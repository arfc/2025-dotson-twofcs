\section{Methodology}

Insert information from the methodology chapter of your thesis that introduces 
the algorithmic choices you made in Osier and, why you chose those methods, and 
why you didn't choose other methods.

Include also brief introductions to both Temo and the SET tool, as well as an 
explanation of how you set up the verification of Osier's suitability. 

You do not have to go into incredible detail here. Generally it's ok to just 
provide enough information for folks to replicate the work and get the same 
conclusions you did. 

\subsection{Subsection}
Recommend including key features of the tools and models, input data, and 
comparison data that are part of the work.
