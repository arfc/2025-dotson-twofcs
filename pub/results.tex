\section{Results}
Start with the critical figures from Chapter 5 of your thesis and build up just
enough detail around them to support the conclusions that you draw. While you
want to keep this level of detail fairly minimal, it must inlude at least a
paragraph for each experiment of the following form (the below is just an
example):

\emph{Figure \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark} shows that Osier achieved solutions
within 0.5\%  of those achieved by Temoa. This level of agreement is well within
the uncertainty expected in an energy system model and Osier can therefore be
considered in agreement with Temo. This clearly indicates that Osier's
multi-objective optimization can be reduced to single-objective optimization at
the level of detail common in existing \glspl{esom}. }

        \gls{osier}, within 10\% of the minimum for each objective axis. Note:
        The number of tested points displayed in this figure is reduced due to
        display constraints.}

Repeat a combination of figures and paragraphs like this until the key results
are communicated. If any discussion is needed to illuminate the interpretation
of the work, you can do so here or, you can include this information in the
conclusions you discuss in the ``Discussion'' section.
