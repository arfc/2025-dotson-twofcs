\section{Results}

Here we discuss the results from the two experiments described previously.
% Start with the critical figures from Chapter 5 of your thesis and build up
% just enough detail around them to support the conclusions that you draw. While
% you want to keep this level of detail fairly minimal, it must inlude at least
% a paragraph for each experiment of the following form (the below is just an
% example):

\subsection{Comparing \gls{osier} and \gls{temoa}}

Figure \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark} shows that \gls{osier} achieved solutions
within 0.5\%  of those achieved by \gls{temoa}. This level of agreement is well
within the uncertainty expected in an energy system model and \gls{osier} can
therefore be considered in agreement with \gls{temoa}. This clearly indicates
that \gls{osier}'s multi-objective optimization can be reduced to
single-objective optimization at the level of detail common in existing
\glspl{esom}.

        \gls{osier} and \gls{temoa} for two objectives. \gls{osier}'s least-cost
        solution is within 0.5\% of \gls{temoa}'s solution.}

\end{figure}

The red-shaded area shows the sub-optimal space sampled with \gls{temoa}'s
\gls{mga} algorithm, while the gray area shows \gls{osier}'s sub-optimal space,
which is within 10\% of the Pareto front. None of \gls{temoa}'s \gls{mga}
solutions overlap with \gls{osier}'s sub-optimal space, which demonstrates that
traditional \gls{mga} does not guarantee improved results along any other
objective axis. 

Figure \ref{fig:osier-near-optimal} zooms in on \gls{osier}'s near-optimal
space, showing all of the solutions therein in green. However, detailed tradeoff
analysis among all points in the inferior region is tedious if not intractable.
Therefore, we present, in red, a subset of 25 solutions selected via
farthest-first-traversal. This strategy guarantees that the selected points are
maximally-different in decision space, thereby ensuring an efficient sampling of
the inferior region.

        due to display constraints.}

Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03} presents the spread of results in the
decision space for each model. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}a shows the
spread of each technology present in \gls{osier}'s Pareto front. Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}b shows the same, but also includes the selected
points from \gls{osier}'s near-optimal space. Lastly, Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}c shows the same kind of distribution for
\gls{temoa}'s \gls{mga} solutions.

  \caption{The design spaces for a) points on the Pareto-front in Figure
  \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark}, b) selected points in \gls{osier}'s
  sub-optimal space, identified in Figure \ref{fig:osier-near-optimal}, and c)
  points generated by \gls{temoa}'s \gls{mga} algorithm shown in Figure
  \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark}.}
  \label{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}a shows that solutions on the Pareto front
only use a few of the available technologies. Only three out of the ten
technology options are present in all Pareto front portfolios: Conventional
nuclear, conventional natural gas, and four-hour battery storage. In contrast,
Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}b introduces two more technology options:
``Advanced'' natural gas (i.e., gas plants with \gls{ccs}) and wind turbines.
The distributions for all technologies broadened. The \gls{mga} solutions from
\gls{temoa} shows that all technologies were used in at least one of the
solutions. Together, Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03} shows that \gls{moo}
can reduce structural uncertainty by modeling other objectives while
acknowledging that the inferior region of a Pareto front may hold appealing
solutions due to unmodeled objectives. Whereas traditional \gls{mga} can
identify distinct solutions in decision space, it cannot guarantee that these
solutions will be measurably better on any other objective.

\subsection{Reanalyzing the \gls{set}}

With data from the \gls{set} we can directly calculate the Pareto optimality of
each \gls{eg}. Figure \ref{fig:full-set-plot} illustrates the Pareto front for
the corresponding many-objective problem with a parallel-coordinate
plot\footnote{Each line on a parallel-coordinate plot corresponds to a unique
\gls{eg}. Although the objective axes are on the same visual scale, the data are
on different scales.}. The \glspl{eg} are highlighted according to their degree
of recycling. Once-through fuel cycles are in red, limited-recycling fuel cycles
are in green, and fuel cycles with continuous recycling are in blue. Eight of
the 40 \glspl{eg} from the \gls{set} were found to be sub-optimal. For those
eight \glspl{eg}, this means that there was another \gls{eg} that performed
better on at least one other objective.

Leveraging a built-in tool from \texttt{Pymoo}, \gls{osier} identified a
``high-compromise'' \gls{eg} that minimizes the tradeoffs among objectives.
Figure \ref{fig:knee-solution} highlights \gls{eg}04, the \gls{eg} that
minimizes Equation \ref{eqn:tradeoff}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
        \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{images/single-eg_set_plot.pgf}}
        \caption{Parallel-coordinate plot of \glspl{eg}, highlighting 
        the high-compromise solution, EG04, in red.}
        \label{fig:knee-solution}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:summary-subset} summarizes the sub-optimal \glspl{eg} and
highlights the rows where \gls{osier} and the \gls{set} disagree. The row
highlighted in \textcolor{black}{blue} corresponds to the ``high-compromise''
solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:knee-solution}. Although the Fuel Cycle
Options campaign discussed it as a ``less promising'' option, and it is Pareto
optimal, we identified this as a point of disagreement because its status as a
``high-compromise'' solution should elevate its consideration.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Summary of the disagreement between the \gls{set} and \gls{osier}.}
    \label{tab:summary-subset}
    \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{tables/non-optimal-subset.tex}}
\end{table}

The rows highlighted in yellow correspond to \glspl{eg} ranked as ``potentially
promsing'' by the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign, the second highest tier, and
which \gls{osier} found to be sub-optimal. All three of these \glspl{eg}
correspond to a fuel cycle with an \gls{ads}. That they are not Pareto optimal
means there are other \glspl{eg} that perform better on at least one objective.
It also suggests the presence of an unmodeled objective that was not considered
in the Fuel Cycle Options study. Finally, the Fuel Cycle Options campaign
truncated 21 \glspl{eg}, which we interpreted as ``not promising.'' However, we
found 17 of these ``not promising'' fuel cycles to be Pareto optimal.

% \textcolor{red}{Does this explanation belong in the discussion section?}
% \textcolor{blue}{I think it's fine here.}
The disagreement between the \gls{set} and \gls{osier} comes from two places.
First, the data for each criterion were binned according to some threshold
values, which discretized the performance data such that all \glspl{eg} within a
bin had the same performance. Second, the \gls{set} based its recommendations on
the binned ``metrics,'' described by the ``Metric'' column in Table
\ref{tab:evaluation-metrics}, while we used the unbinned data for each
individual ``criteria.'' These binning steps reduced the data resolution which
could account for the differences between the \gls{set} and \gls{osier}.

% Repeat a combination of figures and paragraphs like this until the key results

% of the work, you can do so here or, you can include this information in the
% conclusions you discuss in the ``Discussion'' section.
