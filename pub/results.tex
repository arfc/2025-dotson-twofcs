\section{Results}

Here we discuss the results from the two experiments described previously.
% Start with the critical figures from Chapter 5 of your thesis and build up
% just enough detail around them to support the conclusions that you draw. While
% you want to keep this level of detail fairly minimal, it must inlude at least
% a paragraph for each experiment of the following form (the below is just an
% example):

\subsection{Comparing \gls{osier} and \gls{temoa}}

Figure \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark} shows that \gls{osier} achieved solutions
within 0.5\%  of those achieved by \gls{temoa}. This level of agreement is well
within the uncertainty expected in an energy system model and \gls{osier} can
therefore be considered in agreement with \gls{temoa}. This clearly indicates
that \gls{osier}'s multi-objective optimization can be reduced to
single-objective optimization at the level of detail common in existing
\glspl{esom}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \begin{center}
        \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{images/temoa_osier_benchmark_01.pgf}}
        \caption{Comparison between the near-optimal objective spaces for \gls{osier} and
        \gls{temoa} for two objectives. \gls{osier}'s least-cost solution is
        within 0.5\% of \gls{temoa}'s solution.}
        \label{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The red-shaded area shows the sub-optimal space sampled with \gls{temoa}'s
\gls{mga} algorithm, while the gray area shows \gls{osier}'s sub-optimal space.
None of \gls{temoa}'s \gls{mga} solutions overlap with \gls{osier}'s sub-optimal
space, which demonstrates that traditional \gls{mga} does not guarantee improved
results along any other objective axis. 

Figure \ref{fig:osier-near-optimal} zooms in on \gls{osier}'s near-optimal
space, showing all of the solutions therein in green. Points in red correspond to
a subset of 25 solutions selected via farthest-first-traversal.

        \caption{The near-optimal objective space around a Pareto front generated by
        \gls{osier}, within 10\% of the minimum for each objective axis. Note:
        The number of tested points shown in this figure is reduced due to
        display constraints.}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03} presents the spread of results in
the decision space for each model. Figure \ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}a shows
the spread of each technology present in \gls{osier}'s Pareto front. Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}b shows the same, but also includes the
selected points from \gls{osier}'s near-optimal space. Lastly, Figure
\ref{fig:temoa-benchmark-03}c shows the same kind of distribution for
\gls{temoa}'s \gls{mga} solutions.

  \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark}, b) selected points in \gls{osier}'s sub-optimal
  space, identified in Figure \ref{fig:osier-near-optimal}, and c) points
  generated by \gls{temoa}'s \gls{mga} algorithm shown in Figure
  \ref{fig:osier-temoa-benchmark}.}

% conclusions you discuss in the ``Discussion'' section.
