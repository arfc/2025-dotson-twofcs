# Introducing Osier for Fuel Cycle Analysis and Optimization


Open-Source Multi-Objective Energy System Framework (Osier) was developed to close the gap
between energy system optimization models (ESOMs) and multi-objective optimization. This
presentation has three objectives. First, introduce Osier and its capabilities as a modeling
framework.


- MGA is a huge feature that Osier possesses that Dakota doesn't.
