Numerous texts are available to guide researchers in conducting robust survey research online, however this is neither a quick nor easy undertaking. While online survey websites and software are useful for assisting in questionnaire design and delivery, they can also introduce sources of bias. Researchers considering conducting online surveys are encouraged to read carefully about how the principles of survey research can be applied to online formats in order to reduce bias and enhance rigor. In addition to alerting researchers to the pitfalls of online surveys this article also aims to equip readers of this journal with the knowledge of how to critically appraise publications based on online surveys.},

	abstract = {Having developed multiobjective optimization algorithms using evolutionary optimization methods and demonstrated their niche on various practical problems involving mostly two and three objectives, there is now a growing need for developing evolutionary multiobjective optimization ({EMO}) algorithms for handling many-objective (having four or more objectives) optimization problems. In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential {EMO} algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following {NSGA}-{II} framework (we call it {NSGA}-{III}) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed {NSGA}-{III} is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested {EMO} algorithm ({MOEA}/D). While each of the two {MOEA}/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed {NSGA}-{III} is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of modified distance calculation in generational distance ({GD}) and inverted generational distance ({IGD}). These performance indicators evaluate the quality of an obtained solution set in comparison with a pre-specified reference point set. Both indicators are based on the distance between a solution and a reference point. The Euclidean distance in an objective space is usually used for distance calculation. Our idea is to take into account the dominance relation between a solution and a reference point when we calculate their distance. If a solution is dominated by a reference point, the Euclidean distance is used for their distance calculation with no modification. However, if they are non-dominated with each other, we calculate the minimum distance from the reference point to the dominated region by the solution. This distance can be viewed as an amount of the inferiority of the solution (i.e., the insufficiency of its objective values) in comparison with the reference point. We demonstrate using simple examples that some Pareto non-compliant results of {GD} and {IGD} are resolved by the modified distance calculation. We also show that {IGD} with the modified distance calculation is weakly Pareto compliant whereas the original {IGD} is Pareto non-compliant.},

nuclear power projected to grow in countries with increasing electricity demand, corresponding

model to determine total employment - the 'input/output' model - the Nuclear
Energy Agency and International Atomic Energy Agency collaborated to measure direct,
indirect and induced employment from the nuclear power sector in a national economy
The results indicate that direct employment during site preparation and construction
of a single unit 1 000 megawatt-electric advanced light water reactor at any point
in time for 10 years is approximately 1200 professional and construction staff, or
about 12000 labour years For 50 years of operation, approximately 600 administrative,
operation and maintenance, and permanently contracted staff are employed annually,
or about 30 000 labour years For up to 10 years of decommissioning, about 500 people
are employed annually, or around 5000 labour years Finally, over an approximate period
of 40 years, close to 80 employees are managing nuclear waste, totaling around 3000
labour years A total of about 50000 direct labour-years per gigawatt Direct expenditures
on these employees and equipment generate approximately the same number of indirect
employment, or about 50000 labour years; and direct and indirect expenditures generate
about the same number of induced employment, or 100000 labour years Total employment
in the nuclear power sector of a given national economy is therefore roughly 200000

Often, the time scales of the interactions are unknown to an external observer and need to be inferred from time series of observed data. We explore, in this work, the properties of several ordinal-based quantiﬁers for the identiﬁcation of time-delays from time series. To that end, we generate artiﬁcial time series of stochastic and deterministic time-delay models. We ﬁnd that the presence of a nonlinearity in the generating model has consequences for the distribution of ordinal patterns and, consequently, on the delay-identiﬁcation qualities of the quantiﬁers. Here, we put forward a novel ordinal-based quantiﬁer that is particularly sensitive to nonlinearities in the generating model and compare it with previously-deﬁned quantiﬁers. We conclude from our analysis on artiﬁcially generated data that the proper identiﬁcation of the presence of a time-delay and its precise value from time series beneﬁts from the complementary use of ordinal-based quantiﬁers and the standard autocorrelation function. We further validate these tools with a practical example on real-world data originating from the North Atlantic Oscillation weather phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa) is an open source modeling framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of Temoa is an energy system optimization model. Such models have emerged as critical tools for technology assessment and policy analysis at scales ranging from local to global. Energy system models enable a simultaneously broad and deep assessment of technology by considering the economic and technical characteristics of individual technologies as well as their interactions within a well-defined system. The energy system is described algebraically as a network of linked processes that convert a raw energy commodity (e.g., coal, oil, biomass, uranium) into an end-use demand (e.g., lighting, transport, water heating, conditioned air), often through a series of one or more intermediate commodities (e.g., electricity, gasoline, ethanol). Each technology is defined by a set of engineering, economic, and environmental characteristics (e.g., capital cost, efficiency, emissions rate) associated with converting an energy commodity from one form to another. Technologies are linked to one another in a network via model constraints representing the allowable flow of energy commodities. The model objective is to minimize the present cost of energy supply by deploying and utilizing energy technologies and commodities over time to meet a set of end-use demands. Temoa is formulated as a linear programming problem and is implemented in Python using Pyomo, a Python-based open source software package. The design of Temoa is intended to fulfill a unique niche within the energy modeling community by addressing two critical shortcomings: an inability to conduct third party verification of published model-based results and the difficulty of conducting rigorous uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source and data, which enables third party verification of all published modeling work. In addition, Temoa represents the first energy system optimization model to be designed – from its initial conceptualization – for operation within a high performance computing environment.},

One of the difficulties faced is the imbalance between the competing aims of economics, politics and the environment which form the trilemma of energy policy. This article advances that this energy trilemma can be resolved through energy justice. Energy justice develops the debate on energy policy to one that highlights cosmopolitanism, progresses thinking beyond economics and incorporates a new futuristic perspective. To capture these dynamics of energy justice, this research developed an Energy Justice Metric ({EJM}) that involves the calculation of several metrics: (1) a country (national) {EJM}; (2) an {EJM} for different energy infrastructure; and (3) an {EJM} which is incorporated into economic models that derive costs for energy infrastructure projects. An {EJM} is modeled for China, the European Union and the United States, and for different energy infrastructure in the United Kingdom. The {EJM} is plotted on a Ternary Phase Diagram which is used in the sciences for analyzing the relationship (trilemma) of three forms of matter. The development of an {EJM} can provide a tool for decision-making on energy policy and one that solves the energy trilemma with a just and equitable approach.},

Deploying {DACCS} significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other {NETs}. The key factor limiting {DACCS} deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios’ average {DACCS} scale-up rates of 1.5 {GtCO}2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 {EJ}/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that {DACCS} can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 °C. {DACCS} should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.},

	abstract = {{CO}2 direct air capture ({DAC}) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about {DAC}'s current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine {DAC}'s anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art {DAC} technologies are performed, wherein, {DAC} technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions ({HT} {DAC}) and low temperature solid sorbent ({LT} {DAC}) systems, from an energy system perspective. {DAC} capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for {DAC} capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. {DAC} system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that {LT} {DAC} systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. {CO}2 capture costs of {LT} {DAC} systems powered by hybrid {PV}-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 €/{tCO}2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance {DAC}'s role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy.},

The energy demands for low-temperature solid-sorbent {DAC} are mainly heat at around 100 °C and electricity, which lead to sustainably operated {DAC} systems based on low-cost renewable electricity and heat pumps for the heat supply. This analysis is carried out for the case of the Maghreb region, which enjoys abundantly available low-cost renewable energy resources. The energy transition results for the Maghreb region lead to a solar photovoltaic ({PV})-dominated energy supply with some wind energy contribution. {DAC} systems will need the same energy supply structure. The research investigates the levelised cost of {CO}2 {DAC} ({LCOD}) in high spatial resolution and is based on full hourly modelling for the Maghreb region. The key results are {LCOD} of about 55 €/{tCO}2 in 2050 with a further cost reduction potential of up to 50\%. The area demand is considered and concluded to be negligible. Major conclusions for {CO}2 removal as a new energy sector are drawn.

To date, the surface area required for {RE} systems is greater than that for non-{RE} systems, exacerbating existing environmental policy challenges, from increasing land competition, to visual impacts. A suitable metric for comparing the extent of systems is the power density of electricity production, that is, the electrical power produced per horizontal m2 of surface area. This study systematically reviews power densities for 9 energy-types (wind, solar etc.) and multiple sub-types (e.g., for solar power: {PV}, solar thermal) in the United States. Median, mean, and uncertainty estimates are provided for 177 different densities from the literature. Non-renewable power densities are found to be three orders of magnitude larger than renewable densities. Natural gas and solar energy yield the highest median density per non-{RE}, and {RE} system respectively. Solar energy was the only system to experience a significant, positive relationship in power density over time. We apply these density estimates to {NREL} scenarios of future energy systems for state-specific assessments, and find that the largest growth in land use is in the southern United States.},

This paper presents the ranges of realistic potential supply for solar and wind electricity, using a 1km2 grid level analysis covering the whole world at country level. In addition, the potential for building-based solar electricity is assessed. We find that long-term combined potentials range between 730 and 3700EJ/a worldwide, depending crucially on the acceptable share of land—up to 3.5\% of total (non-ice covered) land on earth. Realistic potentials account for limitations such as land-use competition and acceptance, together with resource quality and remoteness as proxies for cost. Today's electricity demand (65EJ/a) is well covered by the range, but constraints may occur in the long run locally. Amongst large countries, Nigeria and India may need imports to meet electricity demand.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic ({PV}) module costs have declined rapidly over forty years but the reasons remain elusive. Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to {PV} modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model – which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction – and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980–2012, contributing almost 25\% of the decline. Government-funded and private R\&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R\&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling {PV}'s cost reduction, through privately-funded R\&D and scale economies, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.},

	abstract = {Effects of climate warming on natural and human systems are becoming increasingly visible across the globe. For example, the shattering of past yearly records for global high temperatures seems to be a near-annual event, with the five hottest years since 1880 all occurring since 2005 (1). Not coincidentally, the single hottest year on record, 2015, also broke records for area burned by wildfire in the United States (Fig. 1 A and B ), eclipsing the previous high mark set just one decade prior (2). Scientists have known for some time that climate is a key driver of forest fires; records from the past and present (3⇓–5) provide strong evidence that warmer temperatures are associated with spikes in fire activity. Therefore, recent increases in wildfire activity as the planet warms are not a surprise. However, just how much of the recent increases in forest fire activity can be attributed to human-caused climate change vs. natural variability in climate? This question has profound scientific, management, and policy implications, yet answers have thus far remained elusive. In {PNAS}, Abatzoglou and Williams (6) present strong evidence that human-caused climate change is increasing wildfire activity across wide swaths of forested land in the western United States. They demonstrate that human-caused climate change has lengthened the annual fire season (i.e., the window of time each year with weather that is conducive to forest fires) and, since 1984, has doubled the cumulative area in the western United States that would have otherwise burned due to natural climate forcing alone. …

We show that, across countries, support for climate policies hinges on three key perceptions centered around the effectiveness of the policies in reducing emissions (effectiveness concerns), their distributional impacts on lower-income households (inequality concerns), and their impact on the respondents’ household (self-interest). We show experimentally that information specifically addressing these key concerns can substantially increase the support for climate policies in many countries. Explaining how policies work and who can benefit from them is critical to foster policy support, whereas simply informing people about the impacts of climate change is not effective. Furthermore, we identify several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors – most notably education, political leanings, and availability of public transportation – that are significantly correlated with both policy views and overall reasoning and beliefs about climate policies. However, it is difficult to predict beliefs or policy views based on these characteristics only.},

	abstract = {An effective response to climate change demands rapid replacement of fossil carbon energy sources. This must occur concurrently with an ongoing rise in total global energy consumption. While many modelled scenarios have been published claiming to show that a 100\% renewable electricity system is achievable, there is no empirical or historical evidence that demonstrates that such systems are in fact feasible. Of the studies published to date, 24 have forecast regional, national or global energy requirements at sufficient detail to be considered potentially credible. We critically review these studies using four novel feasibility criteria for reliable electricity systems needed to meet electricity demand this century. These criteria are: (1) consistency with mainstream energy-demand forecasts; (2) simulating supply to meet demand reliably at hourly, half-hourly, and five-minute timescales, with resilience to extreme climate events; (3) identifying necessary transmission and distribution requirements; and (4) maintaining the provision of essential ancillary services. Evaluated against these objective criteria, none of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. Eight of 24 scenarios (33\%) provided no form of system simulation. Twelve (50\%) relied on unrealistic forecasts of energy demand. While four studies (17\%; all regional) articulated transmission requirements, only two scenarios—drawn from the same study—addressed ancillary-service requirements. In addition to feasibility issues, the heavy reliance on exploitation of hydroelectricity and biomass raises concerns regarding environmental sustainability and social justice. Strong empirical evidence of feasibility must be demonstrated for any study that attempts to construct or model a low-carbon energy future based on any combination of low-carbon technology. On the basis of this review, efforts to date seem to have substantially underestimated the challenge and delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways.},

One consequence is that the relationship of science and technology to political power has tended to remain undertheorized. This article aims to fill that gap by introducing the concept of “sociotechnical imaginaries.” Through a comparative examination of the development and regulation of nuclear power in the {US} and South Korea, the article demonstrates the analytic potential of the imaginaries concept. Although nuclear power and nationhood have long been imagined together in both countries, the nature of those imaginations has remained strikingly different. In the {US}, the state’s central move was to present itself as a responsible regulator of a potentially runaway technology that demands effective “containment.” In South Korea, the dominant imaginary was of “atoms for development” which the state not only imported but incorporated into its scientific, technological and political practices. In turn, these disparate imaginaries have underwritten very different responses to a variety of nuclear shocks and challenges, such as Three Mile Island ({TMI}), Chernobyl, and the spread of the anti-nuclear movement.},

There are some distinct spatial patterns in the {SoVI}, with the most vulnerable counties clustered in metropolitan counties in the east, south Texas, and the Mississippi Delta region. Conclusion. Those factors that contribute to the overall score often are different for each county, underscoring the interactive nature of social vulnerability—some components increase vulnerability; others moderate the effects.},

The article argues that the current conceptualizations of energy justice cannot be separated from the politics of incumbency as, without a decolonial critique, they tend to reproduce rather than transform hegemonic power relations. To be transformative, energy justice must be articulated from the politics of actually existing unsustainability. In other words, the starting position for energy justice must be that energy injustices are already embedded in existing energy systems and energy policies. Drawing on Latin-American decolonial thought, and the work of political ecologists around energy, this article advocates looking beyond a universalized conception of justice towards an approach where justice is based on a sense of place and is informed by the community?s relationship with the land. Using the concept of energy landscapes, the article puts forth an alternative way of understanding energy systems and conceptualizations of justice in decolonial settings.},

In studying such controversies, researchers have a tendency to focus on opponents, the public and local communities. There have been calls for some years now to broaden the scope of social science to include renewable energy technology ({RET}) actors such as project developers, governments or other actors involved in supporting or implementing renewable energy developments. Attention for {RET} actors is still limited and it is unclear where this area of research currently stands. Therefore, we present a systematic review of literature about {RET} actors in relation to controversies surrounding renewable energy technologies and infrastructure. The review of 89 publications shows two categories, consisting of eleven themes in total. The first category concerns {RET} actors' perceptions of the nature, impact and causes of public opposition, including specific groups of people and processes of engagement and decision-making. The second category describes different responses and strategies of {RET} actors to public opposition. Based on these findings, we present three observations about the current state of knowledge on {RET} actors and discuss implications for the broader field of renewable energy controversies. Future research should be directed at unravelling the diverse range of {RET} actors and their practices. This contributes to constructing a finer-grained understanding of the (development of) conflict dynamics between the actors engaged in controversies and action perspectives for the involved actors.},

Beyond greenhouse gas emissions, the power sector is also responsible for numerous other environmental impacts. Here we combine scenarios from integrated assessment models with a forward-looking life-cycle assessment to explore how alternative technology choices in power sector decarbonization pathways compare in terms of non-climate environmental impacts at the system level. While all decarbonization pathways yield major environmental co-benefits, we find that the scale of co-benefits as well as profiles of adverse side-effects depend strongly on technology choice. Mitigation scenarios focusing on wind and solar power are more effective in reducing human health impacts compared to those with low renewable energy, while inducing a more pronounced shift away from fossil and toward mineral resource depletion. Conversely, non-climate ecosystem damages are highly uncertain but tend to increase, chiefly due to land requirements for bioenergy.},

The ability of vulnerability research to capture the complexities of climate-society dynamics has been increasingly questioned, however. In this paper, we identify, characterize, and evaluate concerns over the use of vulnerability approaches in the climate change field based on a review of peer-reviewed articles published since 1990 (n = 587). Seven concerns are identified: neglect of social drivers, promotion of a static understanding of human-environment interactions, vagueness about the concept of vulnerability, neglect of cross-scale interactions, passive and negative framing, limited influence on decision-making, and limited collaboration across disciplines. Examining each concern against trends in the literature, we find some of these concerns weakly justified, but others pose valid challenges to vulnerability research. Efforts to revitalize vulnerability research are needed, with priority areas including developing the next generation of empirical studies, catalyzing collaboration across disciplines to leverage and build on the strengths of divergent intellectual traditions involved in vulnerability research, and linking research to the practical realities of decision-making.},

This paper presents a model-based assessment of the Paris Agreement. In particular, we assess the mitigation policies implied by the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ({INDCs}) put forward in the run-up to {COP}21 by individual member states and a policy that is likely to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. We combine a technology-rich bottom-up energy system model with an economy-wide top-down {CGE} model to analyse the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, energy demand and supply, and the wider economic effects, including the implications for trade flows and employment levels. In addition, we illustrate how the gap between the Paris mitigation pledges and a pathway that is likely to restrict global warming to 2°C can be bridged. Results indicate that energy demand reduction and a decarbonisation of the power sector are important contributors to overall emission reductions up to 2050. Further, the analysis shows that the Paris pledges lead to relatively small losses in {GDP}, indicating that global action to cut emissions is consistent with robust economic growth. The results for employment indicate a potential transition of jobs from energy-intensive to low-carbon, service oriented sectors.},

Thus, with {EnergyPLAN}, the user can take a holistic approach focusing on the analysis of the cross-sectoral interaction. Traditionally disparate demand sectors, such as buildings, industry and transport, are linked with supply technologies through electricity, gas, district heating and cooling grids. In this way, {EnergyPLAN} enables the analysis of the conversion of renewable electricity into other energy carriers, such as heat, hydrogen, green gases and electrofuels, as well as the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and energy conservation.

model (Fishbone et al, 1983) and the many notes and partial documents which have been
written since then. It is divided in three parts, each related to a different type of modeling
paradigm.
Part I deals with the Standard {MARKAL} model, an intertemporal partial equilibrium
model based on competitive, far sighted energy markets.
Part {II} discusses {MARKAL}-{MACRO}, a General Equilibrium model obtained by merging
{MARKAL} with a set of macroeconomic equations.
Part {III} describes the {SAGE} model, a time-stepped version of {MARKAL} where a static
partial equilibrium is computed for each time period separately.
Each Part is further divided in two main chapters, the first describing the properties of the
model, its mathematical properties, and its economic rationale, and the second
constituting a reference guide containing a full description of the parameters, variables,
and equations of the model.
Note that section 2.11 in Part I deals with the {GAMS} environment and control sequences
for running the models. It appplies to all three parts of the documentation.

the numbering of chapters, sections, and pages is continuous across all thtree parts.},

Energy models are widely used for policy advice and research. They serve to help answer questions on energy policy, decarbonization, and transitions towards renewable energy sources. Currently, most energy models are black boxes – even to fellow researchers.
“Open” refers to model source code that can be studied, changed and improved as well as freely available energy system data.

We believe that more openness in energy modelling increases transparency and credibility, reduces wasteful double-work and improves overall quality. This allows the community to advance the research frontier and gain the highest benefit from energy modelling for society.

We, energy modelers from various institutions, want to promote the idea and practice of open energy modelling among fellow modelers, research institutions, funding bodies, and recipients of our work.},

The required types and capacities of balancing measures, amounts of curtailment, and costs associated with system integration need to be assessed for advising policy makers and economic actors. Previous studies mostly exclude storage from model-endogenous capacity expansion and omit concentrated solar power ({CSP}) completely. In this study, we stress the need for grid and backup capacity by investigating an integrated market in Europe, allowing for additional short-term as well as long-term storage and considering {CSP} as a dispatchable backup option. The Renewable Energy Mix ({REMix}) energy system model is introduced and applied to assess the capacity expansion and hourly dispatch at various levels of photovoltaic and wind power penetration. The model results demonstrate combinations of spatial and temporal balancing measures that enable net photovoltaic and wind supply shares of 60\% and 70\% of the annual demand, respectively. The usage of storage and grid can keep curtailments below 20\% of the demand for theoretical {VRE} shares of up to 100\%. Furthermore, we determine that the {VRE} supply structure has a strong impact on the least-cost allocation of power plants across Europe but only a limited effect on supply costs.},

However, sustainable systems with high shares of renewable energy are characterized by growing cross-sectoral interdependencies and decentralized structures. To capture important properties of increasingly complex energy systems, sophisticated and flexible modelling tools are needed. At the same time, open science is becoming increasingly important in energy system modelling. This paper presents the Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof) as a novel approach to energy system modelling, representation and analysis. The framework provides a toolbox to construct comprehensive energy system models and has been published open source under a free licence. Through collaborative development based on open processes, the framework supports a maximum level of participation, transparency and open science principles in energy system modelling. Based on a generic graph-based description of energy systems, it is well-suited to flexibly model complex cross-sectoral systems and incorporate various modelling approaches. This makes the framework a multi-purpose modelling environment for modelling and analyzing different systems at scales ranging from urban to transnational.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a detailed mixed-integer linear optimization model for capacity-expansion planning and unit commitment of a factory's distributed energy supply system. The model identifies the cost-optimal configurations of specified energy-conversion processes and storage techniques to cover the factory's energy demand. The general formulation of the model allows it to deal with a large number of energy-system structures. The main constraint of the model is that it must cover given demand time series for different commodities such as electricity, heating and cooling. For each commodity, storage units with different technical and economic parameters as well as a possible external connection considering time-sensitive prices for import/export and peak demand charges can be defined. The model allows the users to specify processes, for converting between the different types of commodities. The conversion processes can handle multiple inputs and outputs and consider part-load performance as well as start-up behavior. The objective of the model is to find the optimal design and operation of the industrial energy system with minimal investment and operational costs. A case study based on the measured electric- and heat-demand time series of four different factories is presented, investigating the economic efficiency of combined heat and power ({CHP}) units and battery storage systems. The results show, that the decision as to whether {CHP} units are used, mainly depends on the relationship between gas and electricity costs, while the load profile of the factories and the applied pricing program only influence their size. Batteries are only considered in the results when their investment costs are reduced and they have little influence on the total cost.},

It simulates investment, dispatch, and trade, minimizing total costs subject to a large set of technical constraints. In economics terms, it is a partial equilibrium model of the wholesale electricity market. It calculates scenario-based or green-field optima (equilibria) and estimates the corresponding capacity mix as well as hourly prices, generation, storage dispatch, flexible consumption, and cross-border trade for each market area. Technically, {EMMA} is a linear program, written in {GAMS} and solved by {CPLEX} on a desktop computer in about two hours. {EMMA} has been used for a number of peer-reviewed publications as well as in consulting projects. {EMMA} is open-source: the model code and input data are freely available under the {MIT} Software License and the Create Commons {BY}-{SA} 4.0 License, respectively, and can be downloaded from https://github.com/emma-model},

	abstract = {This paper compares various flexibility options to support renewable energy integration across the energy transition using energy system modelling. We analyse new flexibility assets such as electricity storage, heat pumps, demand-side response with existing wet appliances, electric boilers for domestic hot water and distribution grid expansion, along with energy efficiency measures in electrical appliances and building retrofitting. We propose an open-source sector coupling model ({GRIMSEL}-{FLEX}) to minimise, from a social planner perspective, the total cost of the energy system for electricity and residential heating supply in Switzerland, including various types of consumers and urban settings. We find relevant feedback mechanisms among various flexibility options. Firstly, electric boilers have a larger flexibility potential than demand-side response with wet appliances since they reduce storage investments by more than 26\% by 2050 (only 12\% for demand-side response). Secondly, 34\% more electricity storage is needed if heat pumps replace all fossil-based heating and 80\% to replace all heating systems entirely. Thirdly, we find a shift in the operation of heat pumps, electric boilers and wet appliances from night to midday, resulting in larger photovoltaic deployment (22\%–66\% for the residential sector). Finally, electricity storage capacity induced by heat pump deployment is highly dependent on the retrofitting rate. With 1\% per annum, 86\% of storage investments can be avoided and it can be counterbalanced with a high retrofitting rate of 2\% per annum.},

Assessing energy justice in contexts with high cultural and ecological diversity as well as high levels of marginalisation, and a post-colonial history (of domination and resistance to it), requires taking into account the local contextual understandings of justice. Current literature, however, has been mostly developed under the evidence and concepts of Global North contexts, which tend to build in universal ideas of justice, often inappropriate for policy application in the Global South. To contribute to closing this gap, the paper qualitatively analyses the implementation of a large-scale photovoltaic project in Yucatan, Mexico, examining how neighbouring indigenous communities and other key actors perceive, experience and react to procedural and socio-environmental justice issues in the project's implementation. Results show that commonly-used concepts such as consent, participation and inclusion -as currently applied in the siting of renewable infrastructure- are now mostly perceived as legitimation of projects that align with the developer and governmental priorities. Emphasising self-determination over and above the aforementioned concepts is seen as a priority among affected communities for achieving a more socially just energy transition.},

The {VOLL} depends on multiple factors such as type of customer, regional economic conditions and demographics, time and duration of outage, and other specific traits of power interruption. The reviewed literatures show that there are still issues which could be considered in estimation of the {VOLL}, especially for industrial customers. One of the most interesting issues is inclusion of reliability of an industrial plant in estimation of the {VOLL}. This means that how reliability data of the plant components (failure rates, repair time, etc.) can be incorporated in the studies to provide a probabilistic model for the {VOLL} and its related quantities. This paper incorporates failure probability in the {VOLL} estimation of an industrial plant. For this purpose, firstly an estimate for failure rate of the plant components is obtained and secondly, this estimate is applied in failure probability function which is to be incorporated in the {VOLL}.

This paper critically examines the Value of Lost Load ({VoLL}) literature and provides a framework to describe the complexity of measuring the costs of power outages. The {VoLL} metric, which is too often presented as a singular point estimate, influences electric reliability decision-making. This paper improves on prior work by clearly distinguishing applications of the {VoLL} metric between (1) cost-benefit analyses which inform centralized, reliability-enhancing infrastructure investments and (2) decentralized rationing decisions during times of electric supply shortage. Revealed preference approaches to {VoLL} estimation are introduced that offer attractive theoretical advantages over traditional estimation methods. The underlying uncertainty inherent to estimating the costs of power outages implies that cost-effectiveness analysis should remain a key tool for electric reliability decision-makers.},

Switch is capable of long-, medium- and short-term planning of investments and operations with conventional or smart grids, integrating large shares of renewable power, storage and/or demand response. Applications include integrated resource planning, investment planning, economic and policy analyses as well as basic research. Potential users include researchers, educators, industry and regulators. Switch formulates generation and transmission capacity planning as a mixed integer linear program where investment and operation are co-optimized across sampled time series during multiple investment periods. High-resolution production cost modeling is supported by freezing investment decisions and including longer time series and more operational details. Modeling features include unit commitment, part-load efficiency, planning and operating reserves, fuel supply curves, storage, hydroelectric networks, policy constraints and demand response. Switch has a modular architecture that allows users to flexibly compose models by choosing built-in modules 'a la carte' or writing custom modules. This paper describes the software architecture and model formulation of Switch 2.0 and provides a case study in which the model was used to identify the best options for obtaining load-shifting and reserve services from batteries and demand response in a 100\% renewable power system.},

	abstract = {In northern Europe, wind energy has become a dominate renewable energy source, due to natural conditions and national support schemes. However, the uncertainty about wind generation affects existing network infrastructure and power production planning of generators, which cannot be fully diminished by wind forecasts. In this paper we develop a stochastic electricity market model to analyze the impact of uncertain wind generation on the different electricity markets as well as network congestion management. Stochastic programming techniques are used to incorporate uncertain wind generation. The technical characteristics of transporting electrical energy as well as power plants are explicitly taken into account. The consecutive clearing of the electricity markets is incorporated by a rolling planning procedure reflecting the market regime of European markets. The model is applied to the German electricity system covering one week. Two different approaches of considering uncertain wind generation are analyzed and compared to a deterministic approach. The results reveal that the flexibility of generation dispatch is increased either by using more flexible generation technologies or by operating rather inflexible technologies under part-load conditions.},

	abstract = {{PowNet} is a free modelling tool for simulating the Unit Commitment/Economic Dispatch of large-scale power systems. {PowNet} is specifically conceived for systems characterized by the presence of variable renewable resources (e.g., hydropower, solar, and wind), whose penetration on the grid is strongly influenced by climatic variability and constrained by the availability of transmission capacity. To help users effectively capture the nuances of power system dynamics, {PowNet} is equipped with features that enable accuracy, transferability, and computational efficiency over large spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, the model (i) accounts for the techno-economic constraints of both generating units and transmission networks, (ii) can be easily coupled with models that estimate the status of generating units as a function of the climatic conditions, and (iii) explicitly includes import/export nodes, which are useful in representing cross-border systems. {PowNet} is implemented in Python and is compatible with any standard optimization solver (e.g., Gurobi, {CPLEX}). Its functionality is demonstrated on the Cambodian power system.

	abstract = {The adoption of electric vehicles is incentivized by governments around the world to decarbonize the mobility sector. Simultaneously, the continuously increasing amount of renewable energy sources and electric devices such as heat pumps and electric vehicles leads to congested grids. To meet this challenge, several forms of flexibility markets are currently being researched. So far, no analysis has calculated the actual flexibility potential of electric vehicles with different operating strategies, electricity tariffs and charging power levels while taking into account realistic user behavior. Therefore, this paper presents a detailed case study of the flexibility potential of electric vehicles for fixed and dynamic prices, for three charging power levels in consideration of Californian and German user behavior. The model developed uses vehicle and mobility data that is publicly available from field trials in the {USA} and Germany, cost-optimizes the charging process of the vehicles, and then calculates the flexibility of each electric vehicle for every 15 min. The results show that positive flexibility is mostly available during either the evening or early morning hours. Negative flexibility follows the periodic vehicle availability at home if the user chooses to charge the vehicle as late as possible. Increased charging power levels lead to increased amounts of flexibility. Future research will focus on the integration of stochastic forecasts for vehicle availability and electricity tariffs.},

Apart from the benefit of reducing {CO}2 emissions and, potentially, system cost, wind power is associated with negative impacts at the local level, such as interference with landscape aesthetics. Some of these impacts might be avoided by using alternative renewable energy technologies. Thus, we quantify the opportunity cost of wind power versus its best feasible alternative solar photovoltaics, using the power system model medea. Our findings suggest that the cost of undisturbed landscapes is considerable, particularly when solar {PV} is mainly realized on roof-tops. Under a wide range of assumptions, the opportunity cost of wind power is high enough to allow for significant compensation of the ones affected by local, negative wind turbine externalities.},

	abstract = {Planning of sustainable Urban Energy Systems is a challenging task for the many involved stakeholders which requires optimal use of available knowledge for decision support. Therefore, systematic approaches integrating energy models and interactively linking them to real-world data are highly required. In this regard, Geographic Information Systems (called {GIS}) offer as a platform many advantages and can play a significant role in integrating renewable energy sources at the urban scale. The optimal integration and placement of different possible flexibilisation technologies such as storage can profit from the possibilities offered by {GIS} tools. In addition, {GIS} facilitate policy making, allowing for a realistic and multilayer representation of urban energy systems. This contribution first draws an overview of {GIS}-based models for urban energy systems by investigating the current state of modelling. It introduces in a second step, an outline of a transferable {GIS}-based platform for the optimisation of storage and other flexibilisation technologies in urban areas. The model is composed of three main components and deals with the optimal integration of flexibilisation technologies. The fields of applications of the model are, but not restricted to, analysis of the emergence of sustainable cities, self-consumption at the urban levels, autarky measures, capacity demand and economic efficiency, and the integration of flexibility options. The method developed by the authors and presented here deals with the first component of the proposed model which is setting up the spatial framework. The framework relies mainly on spatial features of urban objects extracted from the open source {OpenStreetMap} database. The different steps involved in the spatial framework set-up are extraction and filtering of the data sets and their algorithmic steps which will be introduced here in details. A central finding of this contribution illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using open source data and tools to replicate urban energy features.},

	abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility of fully renewable power systems. Yet the future costs of key technologies are highly uncertain, and little is known about the robustness of a renewable power system to these uncertainties. To analyze it, we build 315 cost scenarios by varying the costs of key technologies and we model the optimal renewable power system for France, simultaneously optimizing investment and dispatch. We add to the literature by studying a consecutive 18-years weather period; by testing all combinations of technology costs rather than changing them one-at-a-time; and by calculating the regret from optimizing the energy mix on the basis of cost assumptions that do not materialize. Our results indicate that the cost of a 100\% system is not that sensitive to uncertainty. Admittedly, the optimal energy mix is highly sensitive to cost assumptions: across our scenarios, the installed capacity in {PV}, onshore wind and power-to-gas varies by a factor of 5, batteries and offshore wind even more. However, in every scenario the total production and storage cost is similar to, or lower than the current cost. This indicates that renewable technologies will become by and large substitutable. Moreover, even if the energy mix is optimized based on cost assumptions which turn out to be wrong, the extra cost is low: 4\% in average and less than 9\% in 95\% of the scenarios.},

	abstract = {To tackle the climate crisis, the European energy strategy relies on consumers taking ownership of the energy transition, accelerating decarbonisation through investments in low-carbon technologies and ensuring system stability and reliability by actively participating in the market. Therefore, tools are needed to better understand an increasingly complex and actor-dense energy system, tracking socio-technical dynamics that occur at its margins and then predicting the effects on larger scales. Yet, existing domestic energy demand models are not flexible enough to incorporate a wide range of socio-technical factors, and to be incorporated into larger energy system simulation environments. Here, a co-simulation design for domestic energy demand modeling is presented and motivated on the basis of four design principles: granularity, scalability, modularity and transparency. Microsimulation of domestic energy demand, through the Python open source library demod, shows that it is possible to achieve high detail and high temporal resolution without compromising scalability. Furthermore, mosaik, an open source co-simulation framework, makes it possible to generate, integrate and orchestrate a multitude of demod-based instances with other independent models, which for the illustrative purposes of this study are represented by a heat pump model. The authors hope that the detailed documentation of the proposed solution will encourage interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts to develop a simulation ecosystem capable of investigating alternative energy transition pathways and evaluating policy interventions through the socio-technical lens.},

	abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: {eLOAD} (electricity {LOad} curve {ADjustment}) and {DESSTinEE} (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in {EuropE}). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23\% points above the change in annual demand, to 103 {GW} in Germany and 92 {GW} in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5 {GW} to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

However, previous research falls short in addressing the risks that joint uncertainties in these processes pose in power systems and wholesale electricity markets. Limiting challenges have included the large areal extents of power systems, high temporal resolutions (hourly or sub-hourly), and the data volumes and computational intensities required. This paper introduces an open source modeling framework for evaluating risks from correlated hydrometeorological processes in electricity markets at decision relevant scales. The framework is able to reproduce historical price dynamics in high profile systems, while also offering unique capabilities for stochastic simulation. Synthetic generation of weather and hydrologic variables is coupled with simulation models of relevant infrastructure (dams, power plants). Our model will allow the role of hydrometeorological uncertainty (including compound extreme events) on electricity market outcomes to be explored using publicly available models.},

This paper presents methods to construct open-access test systems of high spatial resolution to more accurately represent infrastructure and high temporal resolution to represent dynamics of demand and variable resources. To demonstrate, a high-resolution test system representing the United States is created using only publicly available data. This test system is validated by running it in a production cost model, with results compared against historical generation to ensure that they are representative.

	abstract = {Using a linear cost minimization model with a 1 h time resolution, we investigated the influence of geographic allocation of wind power on large-scale wind power investments, taking into account wind conditions, distance to load, and the nature of the power system in place (i.e. power generation and transmission capacities). We employed a hypothetical case in which a 20\% wind power share of total electricity demand is applied to the Nordic–German power system. Free, i.e. geographically unrestricted, allocation of new wind power capacity is compared with a case in which national planning frameworks impose national limitations on wind power penetration levels. Given the cost assumptions made in the present work, the prospect of increasing the wind power capacity factor from 20 to 30\% could motivate investments in transmission capacity from northern Scandinavia to continental Europe. The results obtained using the model show that the distribution of wind farms between regions with favorable wind conditions is dependent upon two factors: (i) the extent to which existing lines can be used to transmit the electricity that results from the new wind power and (ii) the correlation for wind power generation between the exporting region and the wind power generation already in place. In addition, the results indicate that there is little difference, i.e. just over 1\%, in total yearly cost between the free allocation of new wind power and an allocation that complies with national planning frameworks. However, on a national level, there are significant differences with respect to investments in transmission and wind power capacities and the replacement of conventional power generation.

It includes a wide range of features and constraints, such as stochastic parameters, multiple reserve products, energy storage units, controlled and uncontrolled energy transfers, and, most significantly, multiple energy sectors. The formulation is based on mixed-integer programming and takes into account unit commitment decisions for power plants and other energy conversion facilities. Both high-level large-scale systems and fully detailed smaller-scale systems can be appropriately modelled. The framework has been implemented as the open-source Backbone modelling tool using General Algebraic Modeling System ({GAMS}). An application of the framework is demonstrated using a power system example, and Backbone is shown to produce results comparable to a commercial tool. However, the adaptability of Backbone further enables the creation and solution of energy systems models relatively easily for many different purposes and thus it improves on the available methodologies.},

	abstract = {According to the latest Global Tracking Framework (2015), 18\% of the global and 57\% of the African population live without access to electricity services—a key impediment towards social and economic growth. Accelerating access to electricity requires, inter alia, strategies and programmes that effectively address and account for the geographical, infrastructural and socioeconomic characteristics of a country or region. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by developing a Geographic Information Systems ({GIS})-based methodology to inform electriﬁcation planning and strategies. The methodology is applied to Nigeria in order to identify the optimal mix of electriﬁcation options, ranging from grid extensions to mini-grid and off-grid solutions. The case study illustrates how this optimal mix is inﬂuenced by a range of parameters—including population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems and fuel costs for consumers. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Nigeria; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 86\% of the newly electriﬁed population in this modelling effort with 2030 as the time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population densities where a mini-grid or a stand-alone solution are the most economic options; deploying some combination of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies depending on the locational resource availability.},

Instrumental variable models using the between estimator, as well as dynamic panel models are employed to present robust estimates, and to assess the impact of different methodologies on the reported elasticities. The long-run price elasticity of residential electricity consumption is estimated between −0.53 and −0.56. These elasticities are more inelastic than that of industrial electricity use, which is reported between −0.75 and −1.01. The choice of different econometric methodologies has only moderate impact on the estimates. While long-run residential income elasticity estimates are moderately inelastic and estimated around 0.61, industrial electricity use tends to be closely tied to income, with elasticities between 0.76 and 1.08. Electricity demand in all sectors is highly price and income inelastic in the short run. Additionally, population density, temperatures, and policy measures also influence sectoral electricity use. The above estimates can aid the design of European energy and environmental policy.},

Meanwhile, the scalarization method creates multi-objective functions made into a single solution using weights. There are three types of weights in scalarization which are equal weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank-sum weights. Next, the solution using the Pareto method is a performance indicators component that forms {MOO} a separate and produces a compromise solution and can be displayed in the form of Pareto optimal front, while the solution using the scalarization method is a performance indicators component that forms a scalar function which is incorporated in the fitness function.},

	abstract = {Despite recent technical advances, there is a risk that commercial-scale fusion will not play a substantial role in mitigating climate change or alleviating energy poverty due to a lack of public or community support, often referred to as a lack of a social license. This risk is not academic—other technologies, such as fission reactors, spent fuel waste repositories (e.g., Yucca Mountain), genetically modified foods, onshore and offshore wind turbines, electrical transmission lines, and even vaccines, struggle due to rejection by a substantial fraction of society, in other words, a lack of social acceptance. Conventional approaches to this challenge, such as risk-reducing technical solutions (e.g., replacing fission with fusion), or better “communication” or “education,” are unlikely, on their own, to be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Fortunately, fusion is sufficiently young that it has an opportunity to distinguish itself from other energy technologies not just in the way that it uses physics, but also in the way that it approaches society. In particular, fusion can anticipate, rather than react to, public concerns. Looking to other industries and fields of research, this paper describes the risk of a lack of public support and methods to achieve such support, including a social license, bio-ethical review, and responsible research and innovation. These methods are discussed in the context of seven case studies, illustrating practical application. The paper concludes with recommendations for specific steps that fusion companies, non-governmental organizations, academic researchers, government funders, and government regulators can take now to facilitate a long-term social license for fusion energy.},

	abstract = {The shift from carbon-intensive to low-carbon energy systems has profound justice implications as some regions are likely to lose as much as gain from decarbonization processes. Increasing calls have been made to adopt a ‘whole systems’ perspective on energy justice. Drawing on the Multi-level Perspective on socio-technical transitions this paper presents a new comprehensive framework of energy justice in system innovation, proposing to map injustices along three dimensions: 1) multiple spatial scales (regional, national, international); 2) different time horizons (currently experienced vs. anticipated injustices); 3) connections to transition dynamics (injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant system, destabilization of the incumbent system or the acceleration of alternative solutions in niches). The framework is applied to analyse the ongoing energy transition in Estonia, involving interactions between the incumbent oil shale based regime and wind, solar, nuclear and bioenergy as emerging niche challengers. The content analysis of news items in Estonian media reveals an inventory of 214 distinct incidents of energy injustices across 21 different categories. We find that many experienced and anticipated injustices are deployed, often strategically, by certain actors to advocate specific energy futures and to influence current political choices.

	abstract = {This article examines the role of transboundary trust throughout the evolution of relations regarding the Swedish Barsebäck nuclear power plant, located opposite Copenhagen on the narrow straits separating Denmark and Sweden, which created cross-border tensions until its closure in 1999/2005. The article examines changes in transboundary trust in and between the actors relevant for decision-making regarding the plant, during the three phases of the conflict. It focuses on three aspects, which shaped the development of transboundary trust: first, the role played by pre-existing structures of cross-border institutional, interpersonal and ideological trust, secondly, practices of trust-building that various actors applied to maintain, enhance or rebuild transboundary trust, and thirdly, the growing discourses of mistrust and even distrust in the institutions advocating the use of nuclear power – regardless on which side of the border they were located. The article argues that changes in contemporary views on nuclear risk and the concomitant politicisation of the issue of nuclear power broadened the range of relevant actors, and contributed to changing trust relations. It suggests a mutually reinforcing interaction between interpersonal, institutional and ideological trust, and finds few differences in discourses about institutional trust between transboundary and domestic authorities. Its findings highlight the importance of productive mistrust for nuclear safety, and thus demonstrate that both trust and mistrust are important for living with, but also for limiting (nuclear) risk.},

	abstract = {As the energy system changes, metrics used to describe energy use for modelling, socioenvironmental assessment, and other applications should be continually evaluated to ensure ongoing relevance and applicability. Decarbonization highlights the need for fit-for-purpose assessment tools as energy systems undergo an expected transition from mostly fossil to mostly nonfossil resources. Energy use has historically been a high-quality proxy for socioenvironmental impacts of interest, but this characteristic depends on the relatively stable historical relationship between energy use (typically measured as exchanges of marketed energy resources and carriers like natural gas and electricity) and these impacts—a relationship that is increasingly weak. Already, energy use metrics used in tools like energy footprinting and life cycle assessment have developed maladaptations to include nonfossil resources, including many flow resources. For example, nonmarketed energy use is typically ignored; metrics like heat rate are applied to nonthermal resources in ways with limited physical meaning; and definitional exceptions are made without clear justification. Part of the challenge is that energy is a conserved quantity with highly variable quality, but energy footprint metrics have historically implicitly assumed that all energy, and energy use, is the same. The assessment community can improve the clarity and value of energy use quantification under decarbonization by drawing on the experience of footprinting with another highly heterogeneous conserved resource: water. This discussion introduces the concept of a yellow, red, and brown energy footprint framework as an expansion of traditional energy footprinting and analogue of the green, blue, and grey water footprinting framework.},

	abstract = {As energy systems decarbonize, their environmental impacts will change. Historically, energy consumption has been a reliable proxy for environmental impacts of interest due to the dominance of fossil fuel combustion. With a normative transition to decarbonized energy, however, environmental assessment of energy systems faces two major paradigm shifts: 1) environmental profiles are likely to be dominated by embodied rather than operational impacts; and 2) the primary analytical need is for prospective and trustworthy analysis to support system design decisions. Ensuring that analysis of diverse potential decarbonized futures is rigorous and granted legitimacy by potential users is critical if such analysis is to be used and useful as decision support. This review uses both computational and narrative methods to evaluate the English language literature on 12 environmental impact categories and 18 types of decarbonized energy resources or energy carriers to ask: what issues does environmental assessment need to be able to rigorously evaluate to support decisions about designing a decarbonized energy supply? We find that embodied impacts are likely to dominate. We suggest that land use metrics might displace energy consumption as the best single proxy for overall energy supply system impacts, though translating land use inventory data to environmental impacts requires significantly more contextualization than does fossil fuel combustion. Individual energy resources or energy carriers have diverse potential environmental impacts that are highly context dependent and dynamic under technological and environmental change, which suggests that mitigation pathways might depend on project design choices more than technological mitigation.},

To address this problem, a set of guidelines for a fairer, wiser, and more workable siting process—the Facility Siting Credo—was developed during a National Facility Siting Workshop in 1990. This paper presents an empirical test of these guidelines. A questionnaire based on the Credo was completed by stakeholders in 29 waste facility siting cases, both successful and unsuccessful, across the United States and Canada. Using an independent determination of outcome (success), a preliminary ranking of the importance of various Credo principles was obtained. The data reveal that establishing trust between the developer and host community is an important factor in facilitating the siting process. The siting process is most likely to be successful when the community perceives the facility design to be appropriate and to satisfy its needs. Public participation also is seen to be an important process variable, particularly if it encourages a view that the facility best meets community needs. Moreover, a siting process where communities volunteer to host facilities is an approach that holds promise for meeting many of these key success criteria.},

The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon generating technologies vary significantly in the employment that
they create.
Employment is created largely during the construction stage and throughout
the network of supply chain companies needed to maintain operations.
Most employment estimates in the sector are ‘point-in-time’, i.e. they provide
a snapshot rather than a view over the entire plant lifetime. The rapid growth
of wind power thus distorts the contribution it might make in a ‘steady state’ of
neither growth nor decline.
This paper uses existing studies for specified countries to estimate employment
in a steady state for both nuclear and wind energy.
By separating employment into several distinct stages – construction;
operations and maintenance; supply chain; and decommissioning – a steady
state employment estimate is presented for the generation of 1000 {TWh} of
electricity over a year. On the basis of data from France and the {USA}, for this
amount of electricity nuclear creates 461,000 jobs to wind’s 346,000 jobs, i.e.
about 25\% more employment per unit of electricity than wind power.
Other attractive features of nuclear sector employment include comparatively
good pay, long-term job security and a high degree of localisation in the
host country.
Although nuclear generation requires significant investment in employment,
it maintains a competitive advantage over intermittent sources of low-carbon
electricity such as wind. As a highly reliable and stable source of electricity,
nuclear generation does not require additional investment in backup capacity
or storage, while investments in grids are relatively low. When the total costs
of the plant and system are taken into account, nuclear offers not only more

Theconstruction of the 1,172-mile pipeline raised questions about the public’s ability to influence energy infrastructure development considered by the {US} government as “critical” to national security. While numerous scholars and courts have begun to question whether thefederalregulatory process that permitted {DAPL} sufficiently allowed for participation, less work has examinedstate-levelprocesses. In this article, we ask whether actors who participated in the regulatory process at the state-level had sufficient opportunity to influence the siting, permitting, and construction of {DAPL}. We focus on Illinois, analyzing the 2015 proceeding by the Illinois Commerce Commission ({ICC}) to permit {DAPL}. Drawing on fieldwork between October 2018 and May 2020, we argue the {ICC} regulatory process minimized the space available for pipeline opposition in three ways. First, the {ICC} is limited, in an institutional design sense, from integrating broad public opinion into its decision-making process. Second, as a function of its design, pipeline opponents required significant knowledge and resources to mount claims before the {ICC}. Finally, we contend that politically powerful interest groups, especially labor unions and industry stakeholders, shape pipeline politics in Illinois in ways that further limit avenues for formal opposition. Our work raises important questions about the impact of public participation in contemporary energy and environmental governance, as well as how democratic contestation surrounding oil pipelines can openspacefor resistance and transformativesocial change.},

	abstract = {Decarbonizing the United States energy system is a challenging task. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of strong federal climate policy, leaving individual states and institutions to drive the energy sector towards net-zero carbon emissions. {ESOM} tools use linear programming to develop policy insights that may help achieve full decarbonization. However, there is a widely recognized tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost. Adding spatial, temporal, and technological details make these models more realistic, but may make them computationally intractable. Previously, most {ESOM} studies prioritize technology options over spatial or temporal detail. This choice emphasizes the role of technology costs, such as fuel and capital costs, on energy policy without considering operational challenges. This thesis uses the {ESOM}, Temoa to model Illinois’ and the University of Illinois’ energy systems and develops the {PyGenesys} tool to facilitate sensitivity analysis. The sensitivities considered in this work are temporal resolution and the annual capacity factors of wind and solar energy, or the inter-annual variability.

The results of the time resolution study showed that any temporal aggregation above an hourly level may generate misleading results that minimizes the roles of firm clean power and energy storage. Additionally, the role of wind energy is overestimated in models with less temporal detail, and the roles of solar energy and advanced nuclear reactors are underestimated. The study of inter-annual variability showed that energy systems with majority variable intermittent renewables, such as solar and wind, that exclude clean firm power from nuclear power plants exhibit higher energy costs with nearly 63 times the variance of systems that use a majority of clean firm power. Additionally, the amount of capacity necessary to meet electricity demand is greater and more uncertain in systems with high renewable penetration. Finally, based on the results in each of the sensitivity analyses, this thesis recommends that Illinois continues supporting its existing nuclear fleet with “zero emissions credits” and expand clean firm capacity with advanced nuclear reactors by lifting the moratorium on new nuclear builds.},

	abstract = {The global energy system has a relatively small land footprint at present, comprising just 0.4\% of ice-free land. This pales in comparison to agricultural land use– 30–38\% of ice-free land–yet future low-carbon energy systems that shift to more extensive technologies could dramatically alter landscapes around the globe. The challenge is more acute given the projected doubling of global energy consumption by 2050 and widespread electrification of transportation and industry. Yet unlike greenhouse gas emissions, land use intensity of energy has been rarely studied in a rigorous way. Here we calculate land-use intensity of energy ({LUIE}) for real-world sites across all major sources of electricity, integrating data from published literature, databases, and original data collection. We find a range of {LUIE} that span four orders of magnitude, from nuclear with 7.1 ha/{TWh}/y to dedicated biomass at 58,000 ha/{TWh}/y. By applying these {LUIE} results to the future electricity portfolios of ten energy scenarios, we conclude that land use could become a significant constraint on deep decarbonization of the power system, yet low-carbon, land-efficient options are available.},

	abstract = {High-profile modelling studies often project that large-scale win–win solutions are widely available, but practitioners are often sceptical of win–win narratives, due to real-world complexity. Here we bridge this divide by showing mathematically why complexity makes win–wins elusive. We provide a general proof that increasing the number of objectives, the number of stakeholders or the number of constraints decreases the availability of win–win outcomes (here meaning Pareto improvements). We also show that a measure of tradeoff severity increases in the number of objectives. As the number of objectives approaches infinity, we show that this tradeoff severity measure approaches a limit unaffected by the curvature of the tradeoff surface. This is surprising because concave tradeoff-surface curvature results in less severe tradeoffs with fewer objectives. Our theory suggests that this difference gradually dissipates as objectives are added. In a meta-analysis, we show that 77\% of empirically estimated two-objective tradeoff surfaces are concave. We then show how to approximately extrapolate our tradeoff severity measure to higher numbers of objectives, starting from estimated tradeoffs between fewer objectives. Our results provide modellers with precise intuition into practitioners’ scepticism of win–win narratives and practitioners with guidance for assessing the implications of simple tradeoff models.},

We address three questions: 1) how supportive are people of energy transition, 2) how do pre-existing ideas – about politics, economics, climate change, and energy – affect public views on energy transition, and 3) how malleable is public opinion about transition? Using the Canadian province of Alberta – a context where oil and gas are politically and economically predominant –we assess these questions with a population-based survey experiment (n = 1591). Results indicate that energy transition is widely popular. Pre-existing values and beliefs about the economy; political identification with the left-right spectrum; worry about climate change; and hope in the future of oil and gas as a predominant industry strongly structure attitudes about transition. We argue that championing the economic benefits of clean energy will not be persuasive with people who continue to have high hopes in the future economic benefits of fossil fuels. Instead, we suggest policy makers focus instead on the economic risks that come from continued reliance on fossil fuels.},

Although it is projected that wind power will be the main contributor in the energy transition, due to its spatial implications it is targeted by considerable local opposition, thus jeopardising the success of many wind energy projects. Previous research has found that distributive and procedural justice issues are common factors inﬂuencing local public acceptance. This paper explores local public preferences for different forms of ﬁnancial and procedural participation by means of choice experiments and focus groups. The results show that wind power projects are generally accepted by the local public if certain condition, i.e. shareholding and high levels of participation in the decision-making process are oﬀered. Policy recommendations are given on how wind power projects should be implemented so as to counteract local opposition. Deepening the understanding of these issues is of practical importance for future wind energy development.},

            Public support is a key determinant of whether any energy project is developed in democratic countries. In recent decades, scholars have extensively examined levels of support and opposition to energy infrastructure, often with a focus on so-called Not-in-My-Backyard ({NIMBY}) sentiments. As the need for energy infrastructure grows, so does the need to extract insights and lessons from this literature. In this systematic literature review, we evaluate decades of research to identify important trends in topical focus, research findings, and research design. We find a disproportionate focus on wind energy, followed by solar, fossil fuels, and transmission, with most studies conducted in the United States or United Kingdom, and that individuals are more often supportive of energy projects than they are opposed. Scholars have examined the role of many factors in understanding attitudes toward energy infrastructure, and often find knowledge, trust, and positive perceptions about the benefits of projects to be positively correlated with support for projects, although with variation across energy types. {NIMBY} attitudes differ widely in approach and are often plagued by problematic research designs that limit inferences and the generalizability of findings. We provide a detailed discussion of these limitations and suggest areas in which the literature can expand.},

Our analysis finds strong and temporally stable support for policies that promote renewable energy technologies, as well as policies that prioritize environmental protection over energy extraction. We additionally find that partisanship is the most important determinant of Americans’ energy policy preferences and that there is an increasing divide between Democrats and Republicans on energy policy. Our analysis does not show that Americans prefer particular policy instruments, but we do find that support declines for policies when their costs are made explicit and that these declines in support are similar in magnitude for Democrats and Republicans.

Therefore, it is important to understand what mediates local opposition and oppositional action so potential concerns can be addressed earlier. Results indicate that Carolina coast residents are supportive of local offshore wind energy development, despite little to no awareness of such developments and uncertainty about potential impacts. Awareness and certainty of impacts are the largest drivers of support level, followed by perceived impacts. Residents generally believe local offshore wind energy will improve local economies but damage the environment; however, perceived impacts vary by factor importance. About twice as many Carolina coast residents intend social action related to local offshore wind energy compared to those who have engaged in related past actions. Holding a strong position and engagement in past actions are the largest drivers of intended action. For those in strong opposition, increased place attachment increases the odds of intending action, suggesting place-protective action.

	abstract = {The U.S. and Canada continue to face major changes in energy production. Mounting awareness of the climate crisis has placed increasing importance on developing renewable energy sources, however, advances in fossil fuel extraction technology have opened vast domestic reserves of oil and natural gas. Public preferences for energy policy play a role in determining energy futures, but researchers rarely simultaneously compare public views across multiple renewable and non-renewable energies or across country boundaries. Here, we used a 2019 online survey sample (n = 1500) to compare predictors of support for eight fuel sources for electricity generation in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, {USA}. Results indicate the highest support overall for renewables (wind, solar, wave/tidal energy, geothermal) and the lowest for fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), nuclear, and hydropower. Mixed-eﬀects regression modeling indicates that views on climate and the balance between environment and economy were consistent predictors of support across most energy types, while political ideology was less consistent. Perceived local importance of both extractive and renewable energy industries were signiﬁcant predictors of support for some, but not all, energy sources, as were education and gender. Overall, our research suggests that while divisions persist in public energy preferences for both renewable and non-renewable sources, there is the broadest support for renewable energy technologies.},

The lack of current infrastructure has been identiﬁed as one of the main barriers to develop the hydrogen economy. This work is focused on the design of a hydrogen supply chain through mixed integer linear programming used to ﬁnd the best solutions for a multiobjective optimization problem in which three objectives are involved, i.e., cost, global warming potential and safety risk. This problem is solved by implementing an -constraint method. The solution consists of a Pareto front, corresponding to different design strategies in the associated variable space. Multiple choice decision making is then recommended to ﬁnd the best solution through an M-{TOPSIS} analysis. The model is applied to the Great Britain case study previously treated in the dedicated literature. Mono and multicriteria optimizations exhibit some differences concerning the degree of centralization of the network and the selection of the production technology type.},

Yet, the size and in particular the number of binary variables often may lead to difficulties for problem solution. In this work, the potential of genetic algorithms ({GA}) via a variant of {NSGA}-{II} is explored to cope with the multi-objective formulation, in order to produce compromise solutions automatically. The results obtained by using {GA} are compared to those presented in the base model as well as the computational effort to generate the solutions. The solutions obtained by {GA} exhibit the same order of magnitude as those obtained with {MILP} in the mono-criterion problem, and some compromise solutions are produced in the multi-objective formulation.},

The objectives of the model were to minimize the total annual cost and {CO}2 (carbon dioxide) emission and achieve the optimal design and operation to meet the yearly energy demands. Moreover, the economic and environmental beneﬁts under different weights of the objective function were evaluated by sensitivity analysis. The results show that at a neighbourhood level, the {DER} system has signiﬁcant environmental and economic beneﬁts. The system could spontaneously select the most appropriate operation strategy using the developed mathematical model. In multiobjective scenarios, with the increase in the weight of environmental factor, the emission decreases and the cost increases gradually. When considering a single objective, the minimization of cost or carbon emission leads to a poor cost performance.},

	abstract = {Environmental and security concerns urge energy planners to design more sustainable energy systems, reducing fossil fuel consumptions in favour of renewable solutions. The proposed scenarios typically rely on a mixing of different energy sources, thereby mitigating the availability and intermittency problems typically related to renewable technologies. Optimizing this combination is of crucial importance to cope with economic, technical, and environmental issues, which typically give rise to multiple contradictory objectives. To this purpose, this article presents a generalized framework coupling {EnergyPLAN} – a descriptive analytical model for medium/large-scale energy systems – with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm – a type of optimizer widely used in the context of complex problems. By using this framework, it is possible to automatically identify a set of Pareto-optimal conﬁgurations with respect to different competing objectives. As an example, the method is applied to the case of Aalborg municipality, Denmark, by choosing cost and carbon emission minimization as contrasting goals. Results are compared with a manually identiﬁed scenario, taken from previous literature. The automatic approach, while conﬁrming that the available manual solution is very close to optimality, yields an entire set of additional optimal solutions, showing its effectiveness in the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of combinations.

	abstract = {Even though the Republic of Croatia is on track of achieving goals set in the Europe 2020 strategy, to achieve the goals set in the 2030 European framework for climate and energy policies will require more effort. The new 2030 framework calls for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40\% compared to the 1990 level, yet the Republic of Croatia does not have such an ambitious plan. In times when wind plants and photovoltaic systems have reached grid parity in the majority of European countries, this paper analysed the inﬂuence of construction of wind and photovoltaic power plants in order to present the optimal constructing ratio of such systems on the Croatian power system load. Simulations have been conducted in the {EnergyPLAN} model for the year 2012. After the simulation presented promising scenarios, applying the Pareto analysis showed the optimal scenario for generating electricity from renewables, scenario with the lowest import of electricity, scenario with the lowest {CO}2 emissions and with the lowest critical excess electricity production. In addition, all of the scenarios were subjected to a multiple criteria decision analysis in order to ﬁnd the best overall scenario. After showing that the best overall scenario was 1.65 {GW} of wind power plants and 1.6 {GW} of installed {PV} capacity, a multi-criteria analysis was performed in order to observe the behaviour of grading the scenarios. Indeed, all of the simulations proved that {PV} will have a bigger role in the Republic of Croatia than expected.},

	abstract = {Islands’ energy systems present a challenge in energy planning due to a limited amount of resources which could be used to make islands self-sufficient and sustainable. This paper presents a novel approach for defining energy system of a carbon neutral island which utilizes only intermittent renewable energy sources in combination with vehicle-to-grid concept as a demand response technology, where marine transportation has also been taken into account. Integration of power, heating, cooling and transport sectors has been modelled by using {EnergyPLAN} tool, i.e. its updated November 2017 version which is capable of simulating vehicle-to-grid operation in mentioned conditions. Power supply capacities have been selected not by using scenario analysis but by implementing an optimization procedure based on series of simulations in {EnergyPLAN} tool. In order to choose the most suitable power supply system configuration, two boundary conditions have been defined. Firstly, only solar and wind capacities must be utilized. Secondly, total electricity import and export must be balanced, i.e. the island has to be {CO}2 neutral. In order to validate the approach, Croatian Island of Korčula has been used as the case study. 2011 has been selected as the base year for which final energy consumption has been calculated. The final simulation year was set to 2030 in which optimal capacities are installed. It has been shown that configuration with 40 {MW} of wind and 6 {MW} of installed solar capacities presents the least cost solution, while 22 {MW} of wind in combination with 30 {MW} of installed solar capacities provides the lowest amount of total electricity import and export. Analysis of the vehicle-to-grid share reduction has shown increase in total import and export in both cases, while transmission peak loads have not been influenced.},

	abstract = {Variable renewable energy availability has increased the volatility in energy prices in most markets. Nuclear power plants, with a large ratio of capital to variable costs, have historically operated as base load energy suppliers but the need for more flexible operation is increasing. We simulate the techno-economic performance of a 950 {MWt} nuclear power plant, based on the Westinghouse lead-cooled fast reactor, coupled with molten salt thermal storage as a method for flexible energy dispatch. We use the System Advisor Model to model the nuclear reactor thermal power input and power cycle operating modes. We combine this robust engineering model with a mixed-integer linear program model for optimized dispatch scheduling. We then simulate the coupled nuclear and thermal storage system under different market scenarios with varying price volatility. We find that the coupled plant outperforms the base plant under markets where energy price peaks fluctuate by a factor of two or more about the mean price. We show that a calculated power purchase agreement price for the plant improves by up to 10\% when operating under California energy market conditions. Sensitivity analysis on the thermal storage cost shows that the optimal design remains unchanged even when doubling costs.},

These individual contributions, and thus the fundamental mechanisms behind changes in climate extremes, remain largely unknown. Here we apply the probability ratio concept in large-ensemble climate simulations to attribute changes in extreme events to either changes in mean climate or climate variability. We show that increased occurrence of monthly high-temperature events is governed by a warming mean climate. In contrast, future changes in monthly heavy-precipitation events depend to a considerable degree on trends in climate variability. Spatial variations are substantial however, highlighting the relevance of regional processes. The contributions of mean and variability to the probability ratio are largely independent of event threshold, magnitude of warming and climate model. Hence projections of temperature extremes are more robust than those of precipitation extremes, since the mean climate is better understood than climate variability.},

	abstract = {Relative humidity is usually measured in aerological observations and dew point depression is usually reported in upper-air reports. These variables must frequently be converted to other moisture variables in meteorological analysis. If relative humidity is converted to vapor pressure, most humidity variables can then be determined. Elliott and Gaffen reviewed the practices and procedures of the {US} radiosonde system. In their paper, a comparison of the relative errors was made between the saturation vapor pressure formulations of Tetens (1930), Goff-Gratch (1946), Wexler (1976), and Buck (1981). In this paper, the authors will expand the analysis of Elliott and Gaffen by deriving several new saturation vapor pressure formulas, and reviewing the various errors in these formulations. They will show that two of the new formulations of vapor pressure over water and ice are superior to existing formulas. Upper air temperature data are found to vary from about +50 C to \{minus\}80 C. This large variation requires a saturation vapor pressure equation to be accurate over a large temperature range. While the errors introduced by the use of relatively inaccurate conversion equations are smaller than the errors due to the instruments, dewpoint coding errors, and dewpoint conversion algorithms (Elliott and Gaffen, 1993); they introduce additional systematic errors in humidity data. The most precise formulation of vapor pressure over a plane surface of water was given by Wexler (1976). The relative errors of Tetens` (1930) formula and one due to Buck (1981) (Buck`s equation is recommended in the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 3, 1991) are shown. The relative errors in this table are the predicted value minus the Wexler value divided by the Wexler value.},

To reduce the scale of these, this paper discusses different methods for their aggregation into typical periods. Each aggregation method is applied to a different type of energy system model, making the methods fairly incomparable. To overcome this, the different aggregation methods are first extended so that they can be applied to all types of multidimensional time series and then compared by applying them to different energy system configurations and analyzing their impact on the cost optimal design. It was found that regardless of the method, time series aggregation allows for significantly reduced computational resources. Nevertheless, averaged values lead to underestimation of the real system cost in comparison to the use of representative periods from the original time series. The aggregation method itself e.g., k-means clustering plays a minor role. More significant is the system considered: Energy systems utilizing centralized resources require fewer typical periods for a feasible system design in comparison to systems with a higher share of renewable feed-in. Furthermore, for energy systems based on seasonal storage, currently existing models integration of typical periods is not suitable.},

It played a major role in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}); it provided marker scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways ({RCPs}) and the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways ({SSPs}); and it underpinned the analysis of the Global Energy Assessment ({GEA}). Alas, to provide relevant analysis for current and future challenges, numerical models of human and earth systems need to support higher spatial and temporal resolution, facilitate integration of data sources and methodologies across disciplines, and become open and transparent regarding the underlying data, methods, and the scientific workflow. In this manuscript, we present the building blocks of a new framework for an integrated assessment modeling platform; the “ecosystem” comprises: i) an open-source {GAMS} implementation of the {MESSAGE} energy++ system model integrated with the {MACRO} economic model; ii) a Java/database back-end for version-controlled data management, iii) interfaces for the scientific programming languages Python \& R for efficient input data and results processing workflows; and iv) a web-browser-based user interface for model/scenario management and intuitive “drag-and-drop” visualization of results. The framework aims to facilitate the highest level of openness for scientific analysis, bridging the need for transparency with efficient data processing and powerful numerical solvers. The platform is geared towards easy integration of data sources and models across disciplines, spatial scales and temporal disaggregation levels. All tools apply best-practice in collaborative software development, and comprehensive documentation of all building blocks and scripts is generated directly from the {GAMS} equations and the Java/Python/R source code.},

The system consists of 27 technologies used to supply primary energy resources, refine petroleum products, generate electricity, and serve end use demands. The model considers stochastic crude oil and natural gas prices over 4 time periods, resulting in a total of 256 scenarios. Model results indicate that future changes in oil price may have a larger effect on system cost than natural gas prices, but overall the system configuration requires little recourse as fuel price uncertainty is revealed over time. This analysis represents an early step towards our goal of applying stochastic optimization in a high performance computing environment to develop robust, near-term hedging strategies for energy system management.},

The climate mitigation cost savings of the existing U.S. nuclear fleet is denominated in hundreds of billions of dollars [net present value ({NPV})] based on an integrated assessment modeling of the U.S. energy system within a globally consistent framework. Lifetime extensions of the existing nuclear fleet from 40 years to 60 and 100 years resulted in \$330 billion to \$500 billion (all figures are in U.S. dollars) ({NPV}) of mitigation cost savings for the United States under a deep decarbonization scenario consistent with limiting global temperature change to 2°C. The addition of new nuclear deployments in the United States increased the total U.S. mitigation cost savings of the 2°C climate goal by up to \$750 billion ({NPV}). Immediate actions are required in the United States and globally to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century, and once achieving net-zero emissions, they must remain at net-zero indefinitely. Lifetime extensions of the existing nuclear fleet, in the United States and globally, support urgent near-term emissions reduction goals. Additionally, the longevity of nuclear power technologies reduces the need for new capacity additions of all carbon-free electricity sources and supports long-term actions necessary to maintain net-zero emissions.},

	abstract = {This article reviews climate change mitigation policies implemented in five major emitting economies: China, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States. It analyses their historical performance in terms of energy system and greenhouse gas emissions indicators. In cases where policies aim to reduce future emissions, their target performance levels are assessed. The review centres on the sectors of electricity generation, passenger vehicles, freight transport, forestry, industry, buildings, agriculture, and oil and gas production. Most focus countries have implemented successful policies for renewable energy, fuel efficiency, electrification of passenger vehicles, and forestry. For other sectors, information is limited or very heterogeneous (e.g. buildings, appliances, agriculture) or there are few comprehensive policies in place (e.g. industry). The article further presents an explorative emissions scenario developed under the assumption that all countries will replicate both the observed trends in sector-level indicators and the trends that policies for future emissions reductions aspire to achieve. It shows that the global replication of sector progress would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by about 20\% compared to a current policies scenario. All countries analysed would overachieve the emissions reduction targets in their post-2020 climate targets. However, the resulting reduction in global emissions by 2030 would still not be sufficient to keep the world on track for a global cost-effective pathway that keeps temperature increase below 2°C. The findings of this study emphasise the need for transformative policies to keep the Paris Agreement temperature limit within reach.},

Demand innovations are considered to be central to affordable, efficient and politically acceptable energy system transformations, however many argue that not enough is being done in governance terms. In a departure from much analysis on demand policy demand innovations are defined broadly here to explicitly include demand side response, demand reduction and distributed energy – given that each has important roles to play within demand-oriented markets. Demand governance is conceptualised as a long-term political process that is both contextually specific but also open to challenge and change at various points in time. The single case study is Germany where demand governance, recent changes in energy markets, and implications for how the politics of energy are changing are all analysed. This paper reveals the specific ways in which critical policy debates emerge over time and influence political decision-making; the ways in which these debates relate to changes in energy markets; as well as a lack of governance in relation to enabling demand side response and local energy markets.},

There are huge debates among different political parties related to the positive and negative effects of the carbon tax on the energy and environmental policies of the countries. However, carbon tax not only can have effects on the utilization and consumption of energy sources portfolios, but it may also have negative or positive effects on the economy, industry, and social welfare of the countries that should be identified and analyzed, in particular for countries with high energy-intensive industries such as Finland. The purpose of this research is to answer the question: “How does Carbon Tax affect social welfare and emission reduction in Finland?” We use the computable general equilibrium model to analyze the impact of the carbon tax on social welfare and the rate of emission reduction. Considering the fact that Finland has several years of carbon tax policy application background, evaluation of the impact of this policy on Finland’s social-environmental structure is very valuable for other countries, especially newcomers. Our results show that despite carbon tax policy in Finland has been successful in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, however, it has negative effects on the social welfare of Finns. Therefore, an optimum level of the carbon price is recommended for future policy revision},

Answering this question requires scientific insights on the costs and benefits of a carbon tax but also ethical – and thus political – judgements on how we value the damages from climate change that will happen in the near and in the far future. This paper discusses the key tradeoffs for policy makers, reviews the evidence on the social cost of carbon, and discusses global and unilateral policy options. It finds that a price of \$77 per metric ton of carbon is defensible if we give 95\% weight to damages occurring two generations (or 50 years) from now but higher if we want to further reduce the risk of catastrophic change. It is best implemented as part of trade agreements and in combination with R\&D investment., Economics},

After decades of weatherization and bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts faced by financially constrained households.},

Historically, the electricity sector has lacked consensus on how reliability, resilience, and vulnerability differ and how those metrics change depending on the power plant fleet composition. We propose distinct definitions for these metrics and an analytical framework to evaluate power plant fleet dependability. Using data analysis and literature review, we identify fifteen dependability attributes across which we rank eleven power plant types relative to natural gas combined-cycle ({NGCC}) plants. We use {NGCC} as the benchmark because it is common to many locations and is of relatively recent vintage. The framework shows that each power plant type has unique dependability benefits and drawbacks. We provide examples of how researchers may use the framework to evaluate grid dependability qualitatively under different scenarios. We find that assuming all attributes that contribute to grid dependability are equally important and additive, electric grid dependability is best supported when power plant fleets include a mixture of power generation technologies. Then, we discuss scenario characteristics that could alter the prioritization and relationships of attributes. We also find that if current capacity installation trends continue to favor low- and zero-carbon power plants, {US} power grids may benefit from increased resilience and reduced vulnerability at the cost of decreased reliability. We conclude by recommending methods for adapting the framework and quantifying relationships between attributes in individual scenarios.},

At 25–80\% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5–5\% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 {gCO}2/{kWh}, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the energy requirements to make materials on a global scale by focusing on the five construction materials that dominate energy used in material production: steel, cement, paper, plastics and aluminium. We then estimate the possibility of reducing absolute material production energy by half, while doubling production from the present to 2050. The goal therefore is a 75 per cent reduction in energy intensity. Four technology-based strategies are investigated, regardless of cost: (i) widespread application of best available technology ({BAT}), (ii) {BAT} to cutting-edge technologies, (iii) aggressive recycling and finally, and (iv) significant improvements in recycling technologies. Taken together, these aggressive strategies could produce impressive gains, of the order of a 50–56 per cent reduction in energy intensity, but this is still short of our goal of a 75 per cent reduction. Ultimately, we face fundamental thermodynamic as well as practical constraints on our ability to improve the energy intensity of material production. A strategy to reduce demand by providing material services with less material (called ‘material efficiency’) is outlined as an approach to solving this dilemma.},

	abstract = {Energy system optimization models ({ESOMs}) have been used extensively in providing insights to decision makers on issues related to climate and energy policy. However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, {ESOMs} tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for {ESOMs}. We have identified four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to {ESOM} type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.},

Several analyses have shown that nuclear technologies may represent very attractive options for greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emission reductions, especially in countries with high growth projections for energy demand. Our objective is to analyze the role of nuclear energy in long-term climate scenarios using the World-{TIMES} (The Integrated {MARKAL}-{EFOM} System) bottom-up model. World-{TIMES} is a global model that optimizes the energy system of 15 regions over a 100-year horizon (2000–2100). We present energy and emission results for climate scenarios for two levels of {CO}2 concentration (450 and 550ppmv by 2100). We analyze the penetration level of nuclear energy under various sets of assumptions on technology parameters and exogenous constraints on nuclear development to reflect social perceptions. Nuclear energy technologies satisfy a large portion of electricity production in many regions. Most regions experience an energy transition based on advanced oil and gas technologies and hydropower. Other renewable technologies might play a more important role but need further cost reductions or new regulations to penetrate the market in substantial proportions. Carbon sequestration and endogenous demand reductions for energy services are also significantly contributing to reach environmental target.},

However, with the evolution of software systems, cost reductions in energy technology, and increasing customer drive for sustainability, reliability, resilience, and cost predictability, microgrids have become more capable today and have experienced a surge in deployment. Make no mistake, the growth is customer driven. So, what does the future hold for microgrids? If customers continue to seek cost predictability, sustainability, and reliability/resilience in their energy services, then long-term growth in the microgrid industry should be obvious, even in the face of resistance from utilities and policymakers. Where will microgrids be in 2035? 2050? Will utilities embrace microgrids? Will policymakers become facilitators of microgrids? Will municipalities and rural cooperatives use microgrids to hedge costs and improve sustainability and resilience for their citizens/members? This article will discuss the trends and drivers stemming from the early days of microgrids that still exist today which likely lead to an institutionalization and growth of microgrids in the future.},

The purpose of this article is to review existing literature and analyze institutional developments influencing the growth of community microgrids. The literature describes a concentration of microgrid activities in specific regions: {USA}, {EU}, Asia and Australia. Varying reasons for implementing community microgrids were found in the different regions but similar institutional developments occurred, albeit with differing emphasis due to contextual specificities. Formal directions do however influence informal institutions even though their aims differ. Power utilities stand out as a critical actor and both formal and informal institutions put pressure on utilities to update their traditional business models. This article illustrates how informal and formal institutions play a significant role in the growth of community microgrids in existing electricity grids and provide interesting examples which can be utilized by policymakers. Microgrid development is still in a formative phase and further institutional change in the form of updated regulations is needed.},

Assuming minimal excess generation, lossless transmission, and no other generation sources, the analysis indicates that wind-heavy or solar-heavy U.S.-scale power generation portfolios could in principle provide ∼80\% of recent total annual U.S. electricity demand. However, to reliably meet 100\% of total annual electricity demand, seasonal cycles and unpredictable weather events require several weeks’ worth of energy storage and/or the installation of much more capacity of solar and wind power than is routinely necessary to meet peak demand. To obtain ∼80\% reliability, solar-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require sufficient energy storage to overcome the daily solar cycle, whereas wind-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require continental-scale transmission to exploit the geographic diversity of wind. Policy and planning aimed at providing a reliable electricity supply must therefore rigorously consider constraints associated with the geophysical variability of the solar and wind resource—even over continental scales.},

Second, we analyze the internal propagation mechanism of a standard dynamic macroeconomic model by comparing the predictability of model inputs and model outputs.

A system is said to be unpredictable if the forecast distribution, which gives the most complete description of the future state based on all available knowledge, is identical to the climatological distribution, which describes the state in the absence of time lag information. It follows that a necessary condition for predictability is for the forecast and climatological distributions to differ. Information theory provides a powerful framework for quantifying the difference between two distributions that agrees with intuition about predictability. Three information theoretic measures have been proposed in the literature: predictive information, relative entropy, and mutual information. These metrics are discussed with the aim of clarifying their similarities and differences. All three metrics have attractive properties for defining predictability, including the fact that they are invariant with respect to nonsingular linear transformations, decrease monotonically in stationary Markov systems in some sense, and are easily decomposed into components that optimize them (in certain cases). Relative entropy and predictive information have the same average value, which in turn equals the mutual information. Optimization of mutual information leads naturally to canonical correlation analysis, when the variables are joint normally distributed. Closed form expressions of these metrics for finite dimensional, stationary, Gaussian, Markov systems are derived. Relative entropy and predictive information differ most significantly in that the former depends on the “signal to noise ratio” of a single forecast distribution, whereas the latter does not. Part {II} of this paper discusses the extension of these concepts to imperfect forecast models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Historically, its existence has been explained either by preasymptotic behavior of the rescaled adjusted range , certain classes of nonstationarity in time series, infinite memory, or erroneous estimation of the Hurst exponent. Various statistical tests to determine whether an observed time series exhibits the Hurst effect are presented. The tests are based on the fact that for the family of processes in the Brownian domain of attraction, converges in distribution to a nondegenerate random variable with known distribution (functional central limit theorem). The scale of fluctuation θ, defined as the sum of the correlation function, plays a key role. Application of the tests to several geophysical time series seems to indicate that they do not exhibit the Hurst effect, although those series have been used as examples of its existence, and furthermore the traditional pox diagram method to estimate the Hurst exponent gives values larger than 0.5. It turned out that the coefficient in the relation of versus n, which is directly proportional to the scale of fluctuation, was more important than the exponent. The Hurst effect motivated the popularization of 1/f noises and related ideas of fractals and scaling. This work illustrates how delicate the procedures to deal with infinity must be.},

Because of the complex nature of rainfall, the uncertainty associated with its predictability continues to be an issue in rainfall forecasting. The Hurst exponent is considered as a measure of persistence and it is believed that if a time series has persistence (as reflected by a Hurst exponent value greater than 0.5) it is also predictable. However, very limited studies have been carried out to demonstrate this hypothesis. This study, through experimental work on hypothetical data as well as real data, demonstrates that the Hurst exponent can be taken as an indicator for predictability provided that the exponent values at “smaller levels” of the time series are also significantly greater than 0.5 together with the Hurst exponent of the overall time series. It is also shown that it is better to predict the “similarity” aspect associated with a time series (and derive the predicted rainfall) than to predict the rainfall directly.},

	abstract = {The state of power systems is getting more and more unpredictable, by ever-increasing integration of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines. In addition to renewable generation uncertainties, the uncertainty of loads and system component's probable failure make predicting the power systems state more and more difficult. The correlation between uncertain variables intensifies this challenge. Accurately predicting the power network state has significant importance mainly in the decision-making process of system operation, bidding strategies, and management of risk. This study proposes an optimal location and reference set point for static synchronous series compensator ({SSSC}) for maximizing the system predictability, minimizing the total active power loss, and increasing the reliability of the system, simultaneously. A multi-objective biogeography-based optimization ({MOBBO}) algorithm is used to handle the multiple objective functions considering the operational constraints. The uncertainty of the system is modeled using the Latin hypercube sampling ({LHS}) method and the correlation between uncertain variables is handled by the Cholesky decomposition technique. The necessity of considering predictability indices in obtaining optimal location and setting point of the {SSSC} are comprehensively discussed. The probability distributions of apparent power and voltage magnitude of the {SSSC} converter are obtained, which can be very useful in deciding on the sizing of {SSSC}. The performance and advantage of the presented method are evaluated through simulation reports and investigation on the {IEEE} 57-bus system.},

	abstract = {The number of large-scale photovoltaic ({PV}) and wind farms is rapidly growing in Australia and all around the world. When these resources participate in the wholesale electricity market, their uncertain nature of generation results in revenue loss due to the penalty incurred by deviating from day-ahead and real-time commitments. In an attempt to avoid financial losses, they typically bid in the market conservatively. This, in turn, might lead to wasting clean energy and lowering overall profit for the producers. To address these issues, various energy storage devices are considered as a potential solution by academic and industrial researchers alike. In this study, an optimal battery sizing methodology is proposed to improve renewable generation predictability using “Seasonal-Trend decomposition based on {LOESS}”1 decomposition technique, self-similarity estimation, and enhancing it through filtering. The ultimate goal is to determine the optimal battery size that enhances predictability of renewable generation regardless of the prediction technique and time horizon, which necessarily improves the accuracy of predicted values. The goal is achieved by the proposed method through designing a forecasting-technique-agnostic algorithm. For optimal battery sizing, an optimization formulation is proposed including battery degradation through its useful lifetime. Moreover, prediction studies are carried out to prove predictability enhancement using four prediction techniques and three prediction horizons. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving self-similarity index (i.e., Hurst exponent) in the {PV} production time series and economic viability of the proposed methodology in a particular application.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are key components of future smart grids, which integrate distributed renewable energy generators to efficiently serve the load locally. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy generations hinders the reliable operation of microgrids. Besides the commonly adopted methods such as deploying energy storage system ({ESS}) and supplementary fuel generator to address the intermittency issue, energy cooperation among microgrids by enabling their energy exchange for sharing is an appealing new solution. In this paper, we consider the energy management problem for two cooperative microgrids each with individual renewable energy generator and {ESS}. First, by assuming that the microgrids' renewable energy generation/load amounts are perfectly known ahead of time, we solve the off-line energy management problem optimally. Based on the obtained solution, we study the impacts of microgrids' energy cooperation and their {ESSs} on the total energy cost. Next, inspired by the off-line optimization solution, we propose online algorithms for the real-time energy management of the two cooperative microgrids. It is shown via simulations that the proposed online algorithms perform well in practice, have low complexity, and are also valid under arbitrary realizations of renewable energy generations/loads. Finally, we present one method to extend our proposed online algorithms to the general case of more than two microgrids based on a clustering approach.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to take into account short-term power grid operation conditions in long-term prospective analysis in the case of France. It is the first time that the integration of system adequacy and transient stability has been achieved in prospective studies for an electro intensive country, following studies conducted on Reunion Island. The methodology relies on a quantitative assessment of the French power sector’s reliability through an endogenous definition of a reliability indicator related to kinetic reserves into an Energy System Optimization Model ({ESOM}), {TIMES}-{FR} model. The result gives an overview of how the stability of the grid is maintained with an increasing share of renewables using additional back-up and flexible options. We observe that it is technically possible to achieve around 65\% of Variable Renewable Energy sources ({VREs}) in the installed capacity without impairing the reliability of the system. In more detail, the maximum {VRE} in total hourly power production that complies with the reliability constraint was assessed as around 84\% in the 100 {EnR} scenario. However, in order to guarantee this system reliability, the cumulated new installed capacity, in a scenario with 100\% renewable energy sources ({RES}) in the power mix, would represent the double of the Business-As-Usual ({BAU}) scenario over the period 2013–2050. Therefore, major upstream planning would be needed, and that more flexible options i.e. demand-response, storage technologies and interconnections or substitute or additional plants should be considered to satisfy the reliability constraint at any time by providing extra inertia to the system. This modelling exercise shows the importance of power exchanges with neighbours with higher share of {RE} in the power production.},

	abstract = {Public-sector planning problems are typically complex, and some important planning issues cannot be captured within a mathematical programming model of a problem; such issues may be qualitative in nature, unknown, or unrevealed by decisionmakers. Furthermore, there are often numerous solutions to a mathematical formulation that are nearly the same with respect to modeled issues but that are drastically different from each other in decision space. In such cases, some of these solutions may be significantly better than others with respect to unmodeled issues. Thus, a potentially important role of programming models is to generate a small number of alternative solutions that are feasible, perform well with respect to modeled issues, and are significantly different with respect to the decisions they specify. Such a set of alternatives may aid analysts and decision makers in understanding the problem and may serve as a catalyst for human creativity and invention. The Hop, Skip, and Jump ({HSJ}) method has been developed for this purpose. It is designed to produce alternative solutions that are very different from previously generated solutions. Each solution generated is good in the sense that it meets targets specified for modeled objectives. The technique is described in this paper, and is illustrated using a multiobjective linear programming model of a land use planning problem provided by a regional planning commission. In this case, the method is shown to be capable of generating alternative solutions that perform well with respect to the modeled objectives and that are drastically different with respect to the land use pattern specified. Differences among solutions are discussed using visual inspection as well as simple quantitative measures. The technique can be used to extend the capabilities of existing mathematical programming packages.},

	abstract = {An emissions inventory that identifies and quantifies a country's anthropogenic1 sources and sinks of greenhouse
gases is essential for addressing climate change. This inventory adheres to both (1) a comprehensive and detailed
set of methodologies for estimating sources and sinks of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and (2) a common and
consistent format that enables Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ({UNFCCC})
to compare the relative contribution of different emission sources and greenhouse gases to climate change.
In 1992, the United States signed and ratified the {UNFCCC}. As stated in Article 2 of the {UNFCCC}, “The ultimate
objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to
achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt
naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic
development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”2
Parties to the Convention, by ratifying, “shall develop, periodically update, publish and make available…national
inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by
the Montreal Protocol, using comparable methodologies…”3 The United States views this report as an opportunity
to fulfill these commitments.},

These conceptual systems could effectively and economically be utilized, for example, to manage the increasing levels of dynamic variability and uncertainty introduced by {VER} (variable energy resources) such as renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar), distributed energy resources, demand response schemes, and modern energy demands (e.g., electric vehicles) with their ever changing usage patterns. {HES} typically integrate multiple energy inputs (e.g., nuclear and renewable generation) and multiple energy outputs (e.g., electricity, gasoline, fresh water) using complementary energy conversion processes. This paper reports a dynamic analysis of two realistic {HES} including a nuclear reactor as the main baseload heat generator and to assess the local (e.g., {HES} owners) and system (e.g., the electric grid) benefits attainable by their application in scenarios with multiple commodity production and high renewable penetration. It is performed for regional cases – not generic examples – based on available resources, existing infrastructure, and markets within the selected regions.

	abstract = {The electricity market in the U.S. is moving toward an energy mix including more variable renewable energy ({VRE}) sources like wind and solar. This increasing {VRE} penetration is altering the profile of the net electricity demand. Traditionally, flexible generators (e.g. gas turbines) are used to absorb fluctuations in the electricity demand. Therefore, an increase in {VRE} also leads to an increase in installed capacity for such flexible generators which, in turn, may increase the price of electricity. Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R {HES}) are seen as a solution to this problem. The N-R {HES} contains a nuclear power plant electrically and/or thermally linked to an industrial process ({IP}). This paper demonstrates a new methodology and presents the corresponding {RAVEN}/Modelica-based software framework to evaluate the financial performance of N-R {HES}. The novelty of the method is that it explicitly incorporates the stochastic nature of N-R {HES} inputs such as electricity demand and wind speeds. The method is applied to a generic (rather than region-specific) N-R {HES}. The analysis shows that under the right market conditions, economic benefits can be achieved by adding a suitable {IP} to the base-load generator. In particular, there exists an optimal relationship between the {IP} capacity and the demand. Global trends also indicate {VRE} penetration raises the cost of electricity due to the added volatility, an issue only mitigated when operating with high profit margins for the {IP}.},

These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost ({OCC}) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the {US}, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

This work is supported by the {US} Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, under the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative. This paper will provide an overview of large-scale system modeling results and economic analyses that have been completed to date. System analysis results have been obtained using the commercial code {UniSim}, augmented with a custom high-temperature electrolyzer module. Economic analysis results were based on the {DOE} H2A analysis methodology. The process flow diagrams for the system simulations include an advanced nuclear reactor as a source of high-temperature process heat, a power cycle and a coupled steam electrolysis loop. Several reactor types and power cycles have been considered, over a range of reactor outlet temperatures. Pure steam electrolysis for hydrogen production as well as coelectrolysis for syngas production from steam/carbon dioxide mixtures have both been considered. In addition, the feasibility of coupling the high-temperature electrolysis process to biomass and coal-based synthetic fuels production has been considered. These simulations demonstrate that the addition of supplementary nuclear hydrogen to synthetic fuels production from any carbon source minimizes emissions of carbon dioxide during the production process.},

The variation of solar incidence angle and the amount of solar energy received are analyzed for a number of fixed and tracking surfaces. The environment in which a solar system works depends mostly on the solar energy availability. For most solar energy applications, one needs reasonably accurate predictions of where the sun will be in the sky at a given time of day and year. In the Ptolemaic sense, the sun is constrained to move with 2 degrees of freedom on the celestial sphere; therefore, its position with respect to an observer on earth can be fully described by means of two astronomical angles, the solar altitude and the solar azimuth. An approximate method for calculating these angles is by means of sun-path diagrams. Also general weather of a location is required in many energy calculations. This can be presented as a typical meteorological year ({TMY}) file.},

	abstract = {In this study we develop and apply new methods of data analysis for high resolution wind power and system load time series, to improve our understanding of how to characterize highly variable wind power output and the correlations between wind power and load. These methods are applied to wind and load data from the {ERCOT} region, and wind power output from the {PJM} and {NYISO} areas. We use a wavelet transform to apply mathematically well-defined operations of smoothing and differencing to the time series data. This approach produces a set of time series of the changes in wind power and load (or “deltas”), over a range of times scales from a few seconds to approximately one hour. A number of statistical measures of these time series are calculated. We present sample distributions, and devise a method for fitting the empirical distribution shape in the tails. We also evaluate the degree of serial correlation, and linear correlation between wind and load. Our examination of the data shows clearly that the deltas do not follow a Gaussian shape; the distribution is exponential near the center and appears to follow a power law for larger fluctuations. Gaussian distributions are frequently used in modeling studies. These are likely to over-estimate the probability of small to moderate deviations. This in turn may lead to an over-estimation of the additional reserve requirement (hence the cost) for high penetration of wind. The Gaussian assumption provides no meaningful information about the real likelihood of large fluctuations. The possibility of a power law distribution is interesting because it suggests that the distribution shape for of wind power fluctuations may become independent of system size for large enough systems.},

Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type.

Future of nuclear energy is also uncertain because of public apprehensions and subsequent government policies. To overcome the issues derailing these two virtually carbon-free energy sources, a new hybrid or integrated nuclear-renewable energy system is being proposed and seen as an attractive option. Such integrated energy systems are conceived as a nuclear power reactor coupled with renewable energy generation and industrial processes that may simultaneously tackle the concerns regarding grid flexibility, climate change, energy security, optimal return on invested capital, and settling public concerns. Apart from highlighting the key challenges associated with nuclear energy and renewable energy sources while operating as an independent power generation system, the present paper delineates the various aspects associated with integrated nuclear-renewable energy systems. It may be speculated that integrating nuclear energy and renewable energy into a single hybrid energy system, coupled through informatics linkages, would enable to overcome the demerits present when they operate individual.},

Thermal {MSRs} with continual online noble gas stripping of the fuel salt can operate in a regime where 135mXe makes up a notable fraction of the xenon worth, necessitating the implementation of these new cross-sections in the neutronic analysis of these advanced reactor types. To estimate the effect of 135mXe on reactor operation, a simplified mathematical model was produced with one neutron energy group and 135mXe cross section data from the {TENDL}-2015 nuclear data library. 235U and 233U systems were investigated. It was found that the steady-state xenon reactivity worth was considerably higher for some modes of operation when 135mXe was included in the xenon worth calculations. Based on available literature, it was found that proposed {MSR} concepts may operate in the modes of operation where 135mXe has a notable impact on steady-state xenon worth. This work highlights the need to include 135mXe in {MSR} models and the importance of acquiring evaluated cross-sections for 135mXe.},

	abstract = {Wind energy has developed rapidly over the last two decades to become one of the most promising and economically viable sources of renewable energy. Although wind energy is claimed to provide clean renewable energy without any emissions during operation, but it is only one side of the coin. The blades, one of the most important components in the wind turbines, made with composite, are currently regarded as unrecyclable. With the first wave of early commercial wind turbine installations now approaching their end of life, the problem of blade disposal is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future. This paper is aimed at discovering the magnitude of the wind turbine blade waste problem, looking not only at disposal but at all stages of a blade’s lifecycle. The first stage of the research, the subject of this paper, is to accurately estimate present and future wind turbine blade waste inventory using the most recent and most accurate data available. The result will provide a solid reference point to help the industry and policy makers to understand the size of potential environmental problem and to help to manage it better. This study starts by estimating the annual blade material usage with wind energy installed capacity and average blade weight. The effect of other waste contributing factors in the full lifecycle of wind turbine blades is then included, using industrial data from the manufacturing, testing and in-service stages. The research indicates that there will be 43 million tonnes of blade waste worldwide by 2050 with China possessing 40\% of the waste, Europe 25\%, the United States 16\% and the rest of the world 19\%.},

To operate such systems in a stable mode, several control and protection techniques are required. However, modern systems are equipped with several protection schemes with the aim of avoiding the unpredicted events and power outages, power systems are still encountering emergency and mal-operation situations. The most severe emergencies put the whole or at least a part of the system in danger. If the emergency is not well managed, the power system is likely to have cascading failures that might lead to a blackout. Due to the consequences, many countries around the world have research and expert teams who work to avoid blackouts on their systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the major blackouts and cascading events that have occurred in the last decade are introduced. A particular focus is given on the {US} power system outages and their causes since it is one of the leading power producers in the world and it is also due to the ready availability of data for the past events. The paper also highlights the root causes of different blackouts around the globe. Furthermore, blackout and cascading analysis methods and the consequences of blackouts are surveyed. Moreover, the challenges in the existing protective schemes and research gaps in the topic of power system blackout and cascading events are marked out. Research directions and issues to be considered in future power system blackout studies are also proposed.},

	abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models - encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules - have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives ({MGA}) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant {MGA} alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of {MGA} as an energy modeling technique.},

In this paper, we propose a simple method to address some of {PE}'s limitations, mainly its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain motif and the sensitivity of patterns close to the noise floor. The method relies on the fact that patterns may be too disparate in amplitudes and variances and proceeds by assigning weights for each extracted vector when computing the relative frequencies associated with every motif. Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern. Results show better robustness and stability in the presence of higher levels of noise, in addition to a distinctive ability to extract complexity information from data with spiky features or having abrupt changes in magnitude.},

	abstract = {Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error ({FE}) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems’ intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy ({PE}), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated {PE} and {FE} and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected {PE}–{FE} relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.},

We conjecture that the inherent complexity of real-world time-series data, which results from the dimension, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of the generating process, as well as from measurement issues such as noise, aggregation, and finite data length, is both empirically quantifiable and directly correlated with predictability. In particular, we argue that redundancy is an effective way to measure complexity and predictive structure in an experimental time series and that weighted permutation entropy is an effective way to estimate that redundancy. To validate these conjectures, we study 120 different time-series data sets. For each time series, we construct predictions using a wide variety of forecast models, then compare the accuracy of the predictions with the permutation entropy of that time series. We use the results to develop a model-free heuristic that can help practitioners recognize when a particular prediction method is not well matched to the task at hand: that is, when the time series has more predictive structure than that method can capture and exploit.},

	abstract = {Climate change and increased urban population are two major concerns for society. Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.},

	abstract = {Under House Bill 589, the {NC} Policy Collaboratory was tasked with producing a report on the value of energy storage to {NC} consumers. Over the last year, our team analyzed the potential role of storage within North Carolina, culminating in this report. Throughout this report, we have endeavored to be as transparent as possible in our analysis. A unique feature of our effort – unlike other state-level energy storage studies – is that we have also made the underlying models and data publicly available, where possible, in an effort to increase transparency and promote further discussion and debate among stakeholders. These materials are available through the project website.1 North Carolina’s power sector faces a rapidly increasing penetration of renewable energy as well as economic and environmental pressures to decrease coal-fired electricity production. We believe that now is the appropriate time to consider the role that energy storage may play in the state’s future power system. Energy storage can help ensure reliable service, decrease costs to rate payers, and reduce the environmental impacts of electricity production. The electric power system is a very large and complex machine, and several grid-related services must be fulfilled simultaneously by different technologies. In addition, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and cooperatives, independent power producers, and consumers all play a role in how the grid functions. Energy storage can be utilized by different parties to fulfill many services and applications. We evaluate a set of storage technologies and applications, and perform benefitcost analysis to determine where storage can add value. Given the commercially sensitive nature of some data, we are not able to evaluate all storage applications with equal analytical rigor.},

	abstract = {Humanity must face the reality that it cannot depend indefinitely on combustion of coal, gas and oil for most of its energy needs. In the unavoidable process of gradually replacing fossil fuels, many energy technologies may be considered and most will be deployed in specific applications. However, in the long term, we argue that nuclear fission technology is the only developed energy source that is capable of delivering the enormous quantities of energy that will be needed to run modern industrial societies safely, economically, reliably and in a sustainable way, both environmentally and as regards the available resource base. Consequently, nuclear fission has to play a major role in this necessary transformation of the 21st century energy-supply system. In a first phase of this necessary global energy transformation, the emphasis should be on converting the major part of the world's electrical energy generation capacity from fossil fuels to nuclear fission. This can realistically be achieved within a few decades, as has already been done in France during the 1970s and 1980s. Such an energy transformation would reduce the global emissions of carbon dioxide profoundly, as well as cutting other significant greenhouse gases like methane. Industrial nations should take the lead in this transition. Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, replacing coal-fired generating stations with gas-fired stations will not necessarily result in a reduction of the rate of greenhouse-gas emission even for relatively low leakage rates of the natural gas into the atmosphere. The energy sources popularly known as ‘renewables’ (such as wind and solar), will be hard pressed to supply the needed quantities of energy sustainably, economically and reliably. They are inherently intermittent, depending on backup power or on energy storage if they are to be used for delivery of base-load electrical energy to the grid. This backup power has to be flexible and is derived in most cases from combustion of fossil fuels (mainly natural gas). If used in this way, intermittent energy sources do not meet the requirements of sustainability, nor are they economically viable because they require redundant, under-utilized investment in capacity both for generation and for transmission. Intermittent energy installations, in conjunction with gas-fired backup power installations, will in many cases be found to have a combined rate of greenhouse-gas emission that is higher than that of stand-alone coal-fired generating stations of equal generating capacity. A grid connection fee, to be imposed on countries with a large intermittent generating capacity, should be considered for the purpose of compensating adjacent countries for the use of their interconnected electric grids as back-up power. Also, intermittent energy sources tend to negatively affect grid stability, especially as their market penetration rises. The alternative — dedicated energy storage for grid-connected intermittent energy sources (instead of backup power) — is in many cases not yet economically viable. However, intermittent sources plus storage may be economically competitive for local electricity supply in geographically isolated regions without access to a large electric grid. Yet nuclear fission energy will, even then, be required for the majority displacement of fossil fuels this century.},

The study briefly reviews the materials used by various original equipment manufacturers ({OEM}) for wind turbine blades. Successively, it provides an overview of the various recycling methods with interest in recovered materials, mechanical and physical properties, which are used, for estimating a maximum expected value. All recycling processes show a negative effect on mechanical properties with strength loss between 30\% and 60\%. Process energy demands are reviewed, and considerations are set forward to estimate the minimum cost of operating mechanical, pyrolysis and fluidized bed plants in Germany. Ultimately, current applications of recovered material and related markets are explored. Through interviews and secondary data, it is highlighted that despite the lower mechanical properties, grinded material finds applications in traditional processes, cement kilns and new products. It is also found that pyrolysed fibres can be used as insulation material and oils can be easy to distil. Pyrolysis is a relatively expensive process, thereby, distillation of the oils and energy recovery are necessary enablers towards commercial viability. Mechanically grinded material presents the lowest process cost with ca. €90/tonne, thus, below landfilling and incineration and falling within the attention of private businesses. Numerous markets are available for recovered materials from wind turbine blades, primarily for grinded products and secondly for pyrolysed glass fibre.},

	abstract = {Systems planners require consistent and accurate methods to calculate capacity contribution
attributable to variable generation to ensure the stability of the bulk power grid. Long-term
historical data sets allow for characterization and trending of key performance metrics, including
those factors that contribute to resource availability and adequacy. Variable generation, like
wind and solar, does not have long-term historical data sets, and this lack of data limits the
understanding of the long-term implications of variable generation performance. The potential
output levels of variable generation show a large degree of variance over a vast geographic scale,
so the ideal type and capacity contribution of variable generation will differ by region. This
report discusses the known characteristics of regional variable generation along with the current
practices used by systems planners to predict variable generation output potential and capacity
contribution during peak-demand hours to ensure grid reliability},

	abstract = {The planning reserve margin is the predominant metric used in long-term planning models to ensure the resource adequacy of projected power systems. Considerable work has been done to estimate the contribution of variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, to the planning reserve margin, but little work has been done to assess what planning reserve margin should be used in planning models. Typically, U.S.-based models use the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ({NERC})-recommended reserve margin levels. However, historical reserve margins have often exceeded the {NERC}-recommended levels, suggesting that the use of {NERC}-recommended levels in planning models may negatively bias projected future capacity investments relative to real-world trends. Using the Regional Energy Deployment System capacity expansion model, we show that setting the planning reserve margin to observed levels in lieu of the {NERC}-recommended levels leads to substantial differences in near-term capacity additions. Scenarios using alternative specifications for the reserve margin resulted in increased national solar builds of 20–100 {GW}. Given that the magnitude on results from altering the reserve margin level is similar to or greater than many policies frequently analyzed with planning models, careful consideration of the reserve margin level is crucial for developing accurate power sector projections.},

However, most studies carried out in the past have focused on specific countries and those with a European-wide scope have not provided disaggregated results per country. Furthermore, differences between importing and exporting countries have not been considered. This paper aims to cover those gaps. It presents a novel methodology which integrates the aforementioned considerations in order to calculate the employment effects of renewable energy deployment. The methodology is useful to calculate dynamic employment factors (considering technology learning effects) and the specific capacity (based on trade effects) to which these factors should be applied. It is applied to three renewable energy technologies – photovoltaics, wind on-shore and wind off-shore- in the European Union Member States in the 2008–2012 period. The results using this novel methodology broadly confirm the figures provided in other contributions in the literature. The proposed methodology can be instrumental in assessing the socio-economic effects of policies and investment programmes targeting the deployment of renewable energy technologies.},

Governments worldwide are seeking solutions that will ensure security of their energy supplies, while reducing carbon emissions in the fight against climate change. Advocates of nuclear power have reframed the technology as the most reliable, cost-effective and immediate solution to both of these policy problems, and predicted the emergence of a 'nuclear renaissance’. However, there is little evidence to date that suggests a nuclear renaissance has actually taken place. Public opinion polling demonstrates that many remain unconvinced of the need for nuclear power. This paper uses Cultural Theory as a heuristic to understand why the arguments for a nuclear renaissance have been largely unsuccessful. It argues that the failure of nuclear advocates to engage with a wider cross-section of world-views has prevented the controversy surrounding nuclear power from being resolved, and the nuclear renaissance from becoming a reality. In doing so, this paper builds upon a growing recognition of the contribution that social science research can make to understanding public acceptance of energy policy choices.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization ({EEO}) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa
and {MARKAL}, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework.},

While the number of model-based analyses proliferates, insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of {EEO} models and the general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports, or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes, {EEO} model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world outcomes. As a result, modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that {EEO} models should be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of twelve {EEO} models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis.},

	abstract = {The European Union ({EU}) set a 2050 decarbonization target in the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions by 90-95\% relative to 1990 emission levels. The path towards achieving those deep decarbonization targets can take various shapes but will surely include a portfolio of economy-wide low-carbon energy technologies/options. The growth of the intermittent renewable power sources in the grid mix has helped to reduce the carbon footprint of the electric power sector. Under the need for decarbonizing the electric power sector, we simulated a low-carbon power system. We investigated the role of hydrogen for future electric power systems under current cost projections. The model optimizes the power generation mix economically for a given carbon constraint. The generation mix consists of intermittent renewable power sources (solar and wind) and dispatchable gas turbine and combined cycle units fueled by natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration, as well as hydrogen. We created several scenarios with battery storage options, pumped hydro, hydrogen storage, and demand-side response ({DSR}). The results show that energy storage replaces power generation, and pumped hydro entirely replaces battery storage under given conditions. The availability of pumped hydro storage and demand-side response reduced the total cost immensely as well as the combination of solar photovoltaic ({PV}) and pumped hydro storage. {DSR} reduces relatively costly dispatchable power generation, reduces annual power generation, halves the shadow carbon price, and is a viable alternative to energy storage. The carbon constrain defines the generation mix and initializes the integration of hydrogen. Although the model rates power-to-gas with hydrogen as not economically viable in this power system under the given conditions and assumptions, hydrogen is important for hard-to-abate sectors and enables sector coupling in a real energy system. This study discusses the potential for hydrogen beyond this model approach and shows the differences between cost-optimization models and real-world feasibility.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen can be produced from water splitting with relatively high efficiency using high-temperature electrolysis. This technology makes use of solid-oxide cells, running in the electrolysis mode to produce hydrogen from steam, while consuming electricity and high-temperature process heat. When coupled to an advanced high temperature nuclear reactor, the overall thermal-to-hydrogen efficiency for high-temperature electrolysis can be as high as 50\%, which is about double the overall efficiency of conventional low-temperature electrolysis. Current large-scale hydrogen production is based almost exclusively on steam reforming of methane, a method that consumes a precious fossil fuel while emitting carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Demand for hydrogen is increasing rapidly for refining of increasingly low-grade petroleum resources, such as the Athabasca oil sands and for ammonia-based fertilizer production. Large quantities of hydrogen are also required for carbon-efficient conversion of biomass to liquid fuels. With supplemental nuclear hydrogen, almost all of the carbon in the biomass can be converted to liquid fuels in a nearly carbon-neutral fashion. Ultimately, hydrogen may be employed as a direct transportation fuel in a “hydrogen economy.” The large quantity of hydrogen that would be required for this concept should be produced without consuming fossil fuels or emitting greenhouse gases. An overview of the high-temperature electrolysis technology will be presented, including basic theory, modeling, and experimental activities. Modeling activities include both computational fluid dynamics and large-scale systems analysis. We have also demonstrated high-temperature electrolysis in our laboratory at the 15 {kW} scale, achieving a hydrogen production rate in excess of 5500 L/hr.},

Our analysis shows that current hydrogen production costs range from {US}\$2.6 to {US}\$12.3 kg−1 and can be significantly reduced through flexible operation if dynamic tariffs are used. Hydrogen production costs for the 81 utility rates in 20 states are already less than {US}\$4.0 kg−1 and competitive with the fuel cost of gasoline vehicles.

	abstract = {Finland and Sweden are the countries with the most advanced plans for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}). Both countries have also been evoked as good examples in the use of a 'partnering' approach, designed to achieve both a licensable site supported by the community and a balance between fair representation and competent participation. While both are consensus-driven high-trust societies, with similar technological concept for {SNF} disposal, and whose licensing processes have advanced at a fairly similar pace, their nuclear waste policies also differ from each other in certain key aspects. One difference concerns the role of the communities in siting and licensing of the repositories. The paper examines 1) the background for this differentiation, 2) how local final disposal organizations in the host communities, Eurajoki and Östhammar, took shape and evolved, and 3) how differences between the organizations illustrate the divergence between the Finnish and Swedish approaches to stakeholder engagement. While the Swedish approach can be characterized as 'involved partnership' – which shapes the operating environment for the implementer and authorities by challenging and even modifying policies and actions – the Finnish case could be described as a 'bystander partnership' characterized by trust in safety authorities, with community economics as the primary concern.},

	abstract = {For the {UK} to meet their national target of net zero emissions as part of the central Paris Agreement target, further emphasis needs to be placed on decarbonizing public transport and moving away from personal transport (conventionally fuelled vehicles ({CFVs}) and electric vehicles ({EVs})). Electric buses ({EBs}) and hydrogen buses ({HBs}) have the potential to fulfil requirements if powered from low carbon renewable energy sources. A comparison of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions produced from conventionally fuelled buses ({CFB}), {EBs} and {HBs} between 2017 and 2050 under four National Grid electricity scenarios was conducted. In addition, emissions per person at different vehicle capacity levels (100\%, 75\%, 50\% and 25\%) were projected for {CFBs}, {HBs}, {EBs} and personal transport assuming a maximum of 80 passengers per bus and four per personal vehicle. Results indicated that {CFVs} produced 30 {gCO}2 km−1 per person compared to 16.3 {gCO}2 km−1 per person by {CFBs} by 2050. At 100\% capacity, under the two-degree scenario, {CFB} emissions were 36 times higher than {EBs}, 9 times higher than {HBs} and 12 times higher than {EVs} in 2050. Cumulative emissions under all electricity scenarios remained lower for {EBs} and {HBs}. Policy makers need to focus on encouraging a modal shift from personal transport towards sustainable public transport, primarily {EBs} as the lowest level emitting vehicle type. Simple electrification of personal vehicles will not meet the required targets. Simultaneously, {CFBs} need to be replaced with {EBs} and {HBs} if the {UK} is going to meet emission targets.},

This review is a humble attempt to assemble all the available knowledge on {ESSs} to benefit novice researchers in this field. This paper covers all core concepts of {ESSs}, including its evolution, elaborate classification, their comparison, the current scenario, applications, business models, environmental impacts, policies, barriers and probable solutions, and future prospects.

The quality of life in urban areas fully depends upon how people deal with each other and with their environment through transitions towards improved sustainability. The way in which stakeholder involvements occur through transition of marginalised urban areas is unclear. Against this background, the core challenge addressed in this article is: What stakeholder contributions are judged appropriate for transitions towards increased urban sustainability? Exploring recent literature (2013–2016), based on a total of 94 selected articles, it appears that stakeholder contributions have at least three different meanings in the urban sustainability literature; 1) stakeholder based initiatives, 2) government based initiatives and 3) science based initiatives. The three different approaches impact a stakeholder role in the society in different ways, within the scope of the core societal trends of increased use of {ICT}, globalization, and the changing roles of state and science.},

The current transition is no different given the complex, intersecting matrices of power and experience that influence the key stakeholders and actors involved. Local oppositions to the deployment of renewable energy technologies have been significantly higher than expected. In numerous instances, these oppositions have been in reaction to the disempowerment of local rights and entitlements associated with specific developments. Consequently, there is a clear need for governance structures and organisational formats that are participatory, inclusive and mindful of the lived experiences of local people.

The winners are those that will benefit from cleaner sources of energy, reduced emissions from the removal of fossil fuels, and the employment and innovation opportunities that accompany this transition. The losers are those that will bear the burdens, or lack access to the opportunities. Here we review the current state of understanding—based on a rapidly growing body of academic and policy literature—about the potential adverse consequences of the energy transition for specific communities and socio-economic groups on the frontlines of the transition. We review evidence about just transition policies and programmes, primarily from cases in the Global North, and draw conclusions about what insights are still needed to understand the justice and equity dimensions of the transition, and to ensure that no one is left behind.},

Adequately accounting for stakeholders’ values and interests is key to understanding whether stakeholders’ perspectives pose a risk to energy policy implementation. We present results from a case study on the implementation of a renewable energy project in Switzerland, where we applied Q methodology. Three perspectives were identified, namely: 1) promotion for local development and production of energy (‘Local pro-producers’); 2) promotion for a national level ‘greener’ environmental agenda (‘National greens’); and 3) regional government empowerment for implementing energy policies (‘Cantonal leverage’). These three perspectives reflect different sets of values and priorities for local, cantonal and national interests, revealing disagreements with the energy policy at different levels of government. The key basis for disagreement rests on which objectives of the policy to prioritize, i.e. energy efficiency, sustainable development, electricity reduction or production. Despite this disagreement, stakeholders largely agree on the importance of an inclusive and democratic decision process. These findings support calls for the explicit and systematic consideration for deep-seated values and perspectives amongst stakeholders on an evidentiary basis.},

However, no clarity or consensus has emerged about how to define and approach “context”. This article proposes to address this issue using the socio-ecological systems ({SES}) framework. We present conceptual interpretations of context and define and validate the primary set of variables for its characterization. Our analysis is based on a literature review and surveys of people who have implemented these programs in Mexico. We propose “focal”, “very significant”, and “significant” variables, which allow us to define local context within the framework of {PES} programs. The proposed focal variables are a) forest cover, b) opportunity cost, c) livelihood and productive diversification, d) pro-social and pro-environmental motivations and attitudes, e) confidence and cooperation, f) traditional management practices, g) internal organization on the local level, h) land tenure, and i) rules for the management and use of natural resources.},

	abstract = {Stakeholder analysis means many things to different people. Various methods and approaches have been developed in different fields for different purposes, leading to confusion over the concept and practice of stakeholder analysis. This paper asks how and why stakeholder analysis should be conducted for participatory natural resource management research. This is achieved by reviewing the development of stakeholder analysis in business management, development and natural resource management. The normative and instrumental theoretical basis for stakeholder analysis is discussed, and a stakeholder analysis typology is proposed. This consists of methods for: i) identifying stakeholders; ii) differentiating between and categorising stakeholders; and iii) investigating relationships between stakeholders. The range of methods that can be used to carry out each type of analysis is reviewed. These methods and approaches are then illustrated through a series of case studies funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use ({RELU}) programme. These case studies show the wide range of participatory and non-participatory methods that can be used, and discuss some of the challenges and limitations of existing methods for stakeholder analysis. The case studies also propose new tools and combinations of methods that can more effectively identify and categorise stakeholders and help understand their inter-relationships.},

	abstract = {The production of lithium-ion batteries ({LIBs}) has increased in capacity by almost eight fold in the past ten years due to growing demand for consumer electronics and electric-drive vehicles. The social and environmental implications of increased lithium demand is significant not only in the context of policy initiatives that are incentivizing electric vehicle adoption, but also because electric vehicle adoption is part of the vision of sustainability transitions that are being put forth in a variety of contexts. Any evidence that suggests that the externalities of the technology uptake are not being addressed would directly counter the intent of such initiatives. For {LIBs} to be fully sustainable, it is imperative that impacts along life cycle stages be adequately addressed, including lithium mineral extraction. This study investigates how the scope and focus of research in this area are changing and what drives their evolution. Based on a bibliometric analysis, we evaluate the state of research on the issues of lithium mineral extraction, use, and their impacts. The article identifies research hotspots and emerging research agendas by mapping the evolution of research focus and themes. Our analysis finds that research on the socio-environmental impacts of lithium extraction at local level has been very limited. We discuss some research directions to address the knowledge gaps in terms of specific research topics, methodologies, and broader system perspectives.},

That puts us in a position to reflect on a balanced judgment of the viability (or non-viability) of the project and of alternatives. The first three steps follow a systematic procedure. The last two – synthesis and reflection – involve judgment and the ability to think on a broad scale. Guidance is provided by check lists, prompts and cause–effect matrices.

Thus far, initiatives to increase the number of energy renovations have mostly consisted of financial incentives and technical home solutions. Such initiatives overlook the fact that the way people live their everyday lives plays a crucial role in understanding why they choose whether to perform an energy renovation. This study is based on an anthropological investigation of ten Danish families and their decision-making process while receiving free energy advice, which, in many cases, ended as an energy renovation project in the home. During the study, gender emerged as a significant factor in two ways. First, energy renovations were perceived differently by men and women as a consequence of their different everyday practices. Second, there was a cultural norm about the division between what men and women do in the home. This cultural norm placed energy renovation in the male sphere of interest. These findings call for new methods to increase the number of energy renovations that focus on the home, not only as a technical issue that can be improved but also as a living space that contains different gender practices and cultural influences.},

Key elements of Shell’s “World of Internal Contradictions” scenario, issued internally in October 1974, still hold good. Some other elements have since intruded, though they should not have been entirely unsuspected. The paper opens with a summary of the October 1974, risks then anticipated: another regional conflict in the Middle East; further serious threats to energy supplies; and another currency crisis and recession. Changes in social attitudes were thought likely to shift the emphasis from working for high achievement to ‘takers and dreamers’ having a more influential role. There were numerous internal contradictions anticipated in the evolution of this long-term scenario that have been apparent over the past forty years and seem likely to continue. Some fundamentals of the exploitation and use of energy resources were as apparent then as they are now. The future, like the past, seems likely to be riddled with internal contradictions and failure to find satisfactory resolution of important challenges for the human race. But the complexities, uncertainties and time horizons involved suggest modelling is a marginal option compared with other approaches.},

The discussion on the theory of foresight calls for a theory, but rarely expounds on what the scope of theorizing is. The discussion has been centered on philosophy and different frameworks for theorizing, but the scope and form of theorizing have not been explored. We contribute to this discussion by examining foresight through the lens of established theory building literature to map what constitutes a theory in the first place and how it applies in foresight. The main guiding question is “What does a theory of foresight mean?” We fist draw on the literature on theory development in social sciences to discuss a framework for theorizing and then examine the scope of theorizing through it. Our main argument is that when we propose developing (a) theory of foresight, we need to separate three levels of analysis: one is foresight as knowledge creating activity, second is foresight as a process and as a social/organizational intervention, and foresight as theorizing about the future of a given socio-technical system.},

An articulation has a prime objective – something it is aiming to do or change. It has stakeholders, interested parties, some enthusiastic, some reluctant. And it has a factual background that can be researched. But how do these, collectively, bear on the three capitals and, ultimately, on establishing the articulation as a sustainable development? To answer that we need a method. This chapter explains the method. It reviews the components and assembles them into a framework. It ends with a schematic of this framework. It includes a running example that shows how the steps work but is not. The chapter is a sort of executive summary, providing an overview of the approach. Like most executive summaries, it paints the big picture but leaves out much detail. The next chapter – Chapter 4 – provides the detail. We are dealing here with complex systems. “Complex” because many disparate entities are involved; “System” because the entities interact. The challenge, approached in chapter, is accepting this complexity and to find ways of working with it. To do this we develop a five-step method, covering•A statement of the articulation and its size scale and timing;•An analysis of stakeholders and their concerns;•A fact-finding step, assembling information about the articulation and the stakeholders’ concerns;•Synthesis: a discussion of the impact that the facts might have on the three capitals; and•Reflection, in the light of the information revealed in steps 1–4, of the viability and sustainability of the articulation.},

	abstract = {The spatial resolution of energy system optimisation models ({ESOMs}) is often compromised for computational performance. Reducing the spatial resolution impacts the least-cost solutions when optimising the generation capacity and transmission capacity of the {ESOMs} with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources. Previous studies show that the two main effects of spatial resolution reduction are the increase in solar and wind expansion capacity and the decrease in transmission capacity expansion. This paper introduces a targeted method of defining regions during spatial scale reduction by using the max-p-regions clustering algorithm to aggregate similar areas into regions. The attributes used to determine the similarity between areas in the max-p-regions method are population; wind and solar resource potential; and pumped-hydro storage capacity. Two alternative spatial resolution reduction methods were used to compare how the effects of spatial resolution impacted the optimisation results of the {ESOMs}. Evaluation results for three country groups showed that using the max-p-regions method to define regions caused the two effects of spatial resolution reduction to be generally lower than using national jurisdictions. For the case studies Germany and Spain, the results showed that the max-p-regions method identified sets of regions, which were less impacted by the two effects of spatial resolution reduction.},

National-scale energy systems optimisation models ({ESOMs}) have been limited in the past by the lack of sub-national data availability leading to aggregated treatment of spatial dynamics. This review paper first determines how a combination of supply and demand data requirements and socio-economic, environmental and political issues, can challenge the results of a low-spatial resolution model. It also demonstrates the incompleteness of single region {ESOMs} that do not capture sufficient spatial detail. Specifically, 36 multi-regional {ESOMs} from 22 countries with varying levels of spatiotemporal resolution, sectoral focus and planning horizon are systematically identified and comprehensively analysed. The review reveals that existing temporally explicit {ESOMs} with a single sector coverage can permit regional disaggregation up to the first-level administrative divisions within a country (such as state and province) while maintaining computationally tractable. Findings from the literature review also show when, how, and to what extent higher spatial resolution impact on the results of energy system analysis. (1) Finer spatial resolution in {ESOMs} offers significant added value for regions with heterogeneous renewable potential or across regions with higher variability in energy service demands. However, in homogeneous areas, aggregated single-region modelling is more efficient. (2) Spatially resolved models can significantly change the results of the scenarios with very high shares of variable renewable energies. But it is not straightforward to find a direct relationship between the level of geographic disaggregation and penetration of renewable energies. This trade-off should be explored case-by-case. (3) Total system costs can be under- or over-estimated in various levels of spatial resolutions. Disaggregation of renewable resources leads to lower costs, and disaggregation of transmission grids leads to higher costs.},

This paper investigates the prospects for realization of the 100\% renewable energy system in Macedonia by making use of the {EnergyPLAN} model. Analysis was conducted for two renewable scenarios designed for the years 2030 and 2050. First scenario, the 50\% renewable energy system, has been created for the year 2030 and represents the first step towards the 100\% renewable energy future of Macedonia. The second scenario has been designed for the 100\% renewable energy system based only on the renewable energy sources ({RES}) in the year 2050. Special attention in the design of these systems has been given to intermittent {RES} and to storage technologies. The analysis reveals that at the moment the 50\% renewable energy system seems much more likely than the 100\% renewable energy system, but with additional energy efficiency measures, which will lead to a decrease of consumption and with installation of new generation capacities this goal can be easily achieved.},

	abstract = {This study presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their all-purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) to ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight ({WWS}). The plans contemplate 80–85\% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100\% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of ∼39.3\% with ∼82.4\% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with ∼30.9\% onshore wind, ∼19.1\% offshore wind, ∼30.7\% utility-scale photovoltaics ({PV}), ∼7.2\% rooftop {PV}, ∼7.3\% concentrated solar power ({CSP}) with storage, ∼1.25\% geothermal power, ∼0.37\% wave power, ∼0.14\% tidal power, and ∼3.01\% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4\% and 7.2\% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by {CSP} with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide ∼3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and ∼2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the ∼3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate ∼62 000 (19 000–115 000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and ∼46 000 (12 000–104 000) in 2050, avoiding ∼\$600 (\$85–\$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to ∼3.6 (0.5–14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate ∼\$3.3 (1.9–7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving ∼\$260 (190–320) per year in energy costs (\$2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by ∼\$1500 (210–6000) per year and ∼\$8300 (4700–17 600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be ∼0.42\% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be ∼1.6\% of U.S. land. Thus, 100\% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.},

At the core of this task is the switch to 100\% renewables across all sectors on the same time horizon. Conventional technologies fueled by fossil and nuclear energies are, according to the vast majority of current cost calculations, energetically inefficient, too expensive, and too slow in expansion to be able to deliver a substantial contribution to rapid climate protection. We present the first comprehensive energy scenario that shows the way to 100\% renewable energy for all energy sectors by 2030. The result of the calculations is a cost-effective energy system that is compatible with the German share of necessary greenhouse gas reduction. This study shows a target system of generation, conversion, and storage technologies that can achieve the transformation to 100\% renewable energy in all energy sectors—electricity, heat, and mobility—in time and at competitive costs below the costs of the current system. Moreover, we demonstrate the huge cost effect that arises if southern Germany renounces its onshore wind resources and find that this would substantially increase the need for high-voltage direct-current transmission capacity.},

By 2050, not only greenhouse gas emissions have to be eliminated in all energy sectors: power, heat, transport and industry but also these sectors should be closely coupled allowing maximum synergy effects and efficiency. A tool allowing modelling of complex energy system transition for power, heat, transport and industry sectors, responsible for over 75\% of the {CO}2eq emissions, in full hourly resolution, is presented in this research and tested for the case of Kazakhstan. The results show that transition towards a 100\% sustainable and renewable energy based system by 2050 is possible even for the case of severe climate conditions and an energy intensive industry, observed in Kazakhstan. The power sector becomes backbone of the entire energy system, due to more intense electrification induced sector coupling. The results show that electrification and integration of sectors enables additional flexibility, leading to more efficient systems and lower energy supply cost, even though integration effect varies from sector to sector. The levelised cost of electricity can be reduced from 62 €/{MWh} in 2015 to 46 €/{MWh} in 2050 in a fully integrated system, while the cost of heat stays on a comparable level within the range of 30–35 €/{MWh}, leading to an energy system cost on a level of 40–45 €/{MWh}. Transition towards 100\% renewable energy supply shrinks {CO}2eq emissions from these sectors to zero in 2050 with 90\% of the reduction achieved by 2040.},

The model is comprised of five scenarios for 100\% renewable energy power systems in North-East Asia with different high voltage direct current transmission grid development levels, including industrial gas demand and additional energy security. Renewables can supply enough energy to cover the estimated electricity and gas demands of the area in the year 2030 and deliver more than 2000TWhth of heat on a cost competitive level of 84€/{MWhel} for electricity. Further, this can be accomplished for a synthetic natural gas price at the 2013 Japanese liquefied natural gas import price level and at no additional generation costs for the available heat. The total area system cost could reach 69.4€/{MWhel}, if only the electricity sector is taken into account. In this system about 20\% of the energy is exchanged between the 13 regions, reflecting a rather decentralized character which is supplied 27\% by stored energy. The major storage technologies are batteries for daily storage and power-to-gas for seasonal storage. Prosumers are likely to play a significant role due to favourable economics. A highly resilient energy system with very high energy security standards would increase the electricity cost by 23\% to 85.6€/{MWhel}. The results clearly show that a 100\% renewable energy based system is feasible and lower in cost than nuclear energy and fossil carbon capture and storage alternatives.},

	abstract = {Public support is a key determinant of whether any energy project is developed in democratic countries. In recent decades, scholars have extensively examined levels of support and opposition to energy infrastructure, often with a focus on so-called Not-in-My-Backyard ({NIMBY}) sentiments. As the need for energy infrastructure grows, so does the need to extract insights and lessons from this literature. In this systematic literature review, we evaluate decades of research to identify important trends in topical focus, research findings, and research design. We find a disproportionate focus on wind energy, followed by solar, fossil fuels, and transmission, with most studies conducted in the United States or United Kingdom, and that individuals are more often supportive of energy projects than they are opposed. Scholars have examined the role of many factors in understanding attitudes toward energy infrastructure, and often find knowledge, trust, and positive perceptions about the benefits of projects to be positively correlated with support for projects, although with variation across energy types. {NIMBY} attitudes differ widely in approach and are often plagued by problematic research designs that limit inferences and the generalizability of findings. We provide a detailed discussion of these limitations and suggest areas in which the literature can expand.},

	abstract = {Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to \$131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93\%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 °C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based {CO}2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth’s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately.},

This paper reports a comprehensive literature review for 1989–2013 (inclusive), the first 25 years in which this topic appeared in scientific journals. It explores the extent to which articles have identified potentially catastrophic, civilization-endangering health risks associated with climate change. Methods: {PubMed} and Google Scholar were primarily used to identify articles which were then ranked on a three-point scale. Each score reflected the extent to which papers discussed global systemic risk. Citations were also analyzed. Results: Of 2143 analyzed papers 1546 (72\%) were scored as one. Their citations (165,133) were 82\% of the total. The proportion of annual papers scored as three was initially high, as were their citations but declined to almost zero by 1996, before rising slightly from 2006. Conclusions: The enormous expansion of the literature appropriately reflects increased understanding of the importance of climate change to global health. However, recognition of the most severe, existential, health risks from climate change was generally low. Most papers instead focused on infectious diseases, direct heat effects and other disciplinary-bounded phenomena and consequences, even though scientific advances have long called for more inter-disciplinary collaboration.},

I investigate this episode through a process tracing case study, incorporating qualitative content analysis and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Results suggest that stakeholders strategically framed their policies in terms of economic benefits, and other aspects of a policy's design, as opposed to focusing on climate change or climate science. In this way, Illinois was able to pass a comprehensive climate-energy policy with bipartisan support—an outcome infrequently seen in other states around the country.},

This cooling trend is offset by {\textasciitilde}20\% reduction in global {SO}2 emissions that weakens the aerosol cooling effect, causing short-term warming. As a result, we estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01 ± 0.005 °C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3 °C by 2050.},

	abstract = {The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate. It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in Washington {DC} in November 2018, where these themes and issues were discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century.

A methodology for determining the minimum level of performance required for a parameter to have a statistically significant impact on {CO}2 abatement cost is developed and used to evaluate the impact of eight key parameters of low carbon energy supply technologies on the cost of {CO}2 abatement. The capital cost of nuclear technology is found to have the greatest impact of the parameters studied. The cost of biomass and {CCS} technologies also have impacts, while their efficiencies have little, if any. Sensitivity analysis of the results with respect to population, {GDP}, and {CO}2 emission constraint show that the minimum performance level and impact of nuclear technologies is consistent across the socioeconomic scenarios studied, while the other technology parameters show different performance under higher population, lower {GDP} scenarios. Solar technology was found to have a small impact, and then only at very low costs. These results indicate that the cost of nuclear is the single most important driver of abatement cost, and that trading efficiency for cost may make biomass and {CCS} technologies more competitive.},

	abstract = {Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.},

	abstract = {To limit the computational cost, bottom-up long-term ({LT}) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation and do not consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simpliﬁcations have been shown to have a signiﬁcant impact on the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the ﬁrst goal of this work is to quantify which of these simpliﬁcations has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail are quantiﬁed for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources ({IRES}). For a high penetration of {IRES}, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating detailed techno-economic operational constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal representation are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of deﬁning the time slices to explicitly account for {IRES} variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time slices. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic ﬂuctuations of {IRES} can be accounted for.},

The lack of transparency and standardization, however, renders the assessment of model suitability for specific policy questions difficult. Therefore, this paper systematically assesses the ability of energy system models to answer major energy policy questions. It examines the existing literature on model comparison schemes, then proposes a set of criteria to compare a sample of 40 models. Besides, a novel, model-oriented approach is developed in order to cluster energy policy questions. Finally, the model capabilities and the policy questions are brought together by quantifying the gap between models and policy questions. The results show that some models are very well able to answer a wide range of energy policy questions, whereas others are only suitable for a specific area of energy policy. The representation of the distribution grid, the endogenous adjustment of demand, and the technical flexibility of the energy system are among the features, where models generally lag behind. Our results provide policy-makers with guidance on crucial model features with respect to a selection of energy policy questions and suggest potential funding priorities for future energy system modeling.},

Nuclear power reduces costs significantly if carbon storage capacity is low but is replaceable if the capacity is abundant and technology available. The same holds for the cost of renewables.

Electricity system planning at the monthly timescale can be improved by adapting climate forecasts to estimate electricity demand and utilizing energy models to estimate monthly electricity generation and associated operational costs. The objective of this paper is to develop and test a computationally efficient model that can support seasonal planning while preserving key aspects of system operation over hourly and daily timeframes. To do so, an energy system optimization model is repurposed for seasonal planning using features drawn from a unit commitment model. Different scenarios utilizing a well-known test system are used to evaluate the errors associated with both the repurposed energy system model and an imperfect load forecast. The results show that the energy system optimization model using an imperfect load forecast produces differences in monthly cost and generation levels that are less than 2\% compared with a unit commitment model using a perfect load forecast. The enhanced energy system optimization model can be solved approximately 100 times faster than the unit commitment model, making it a suitable tool for future work aimed at evaluating seasonal electricity generation and demand under uncertainty.},

When hurricane trends are included, 2040 electricity cost projections increase by 32\% based on historical hurricane frequencies and by 82\% for increased hurricane frequencies.

This article responds to calls for sociological research on both ascriptions of {NIMBYism} and the use of deficit models. Through an analysis of interviews with key actors in the renewable energy industry, we explore the ways in which a discourse of {NIMBYism} is evident in their descriptions of local wind farm opponents. We conceptualize this discourse as embodying an array of deficit models of the public and public knowledge.

First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current {ESMs} and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis ({MCA}) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of {MARKAL}, {TIMES}, {REMix}, {PRIMES}, and {METIS}. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated {ESM} is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model.,

We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives ({MGA}) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5\% offers a large range of possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along with some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement appear essential to keep costs within 10\% of the optimum.},

Economic modelling and optimisation was concentrating on evaluation of possibilities to construct a new energy source. The {MESSAGE} modelling tool was used for modelling and optimisation of the future energy system development. In this study, the introduced approach was applied focussing on small and medium nuclear reactor ({SMR}), which could be one of the future energy source options in Lithuania. As an example of {SMR}, the {IRIS} (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) nuclear reactor was chosen in this study. Finally, the analysis of uncertainty and sensitivity enabled to investigate how uncertain are results of modelling and how this uncertainty is sensitive to the uncertainty of model parameters. In the particular case we have analysed how Lithuanian energy system development scenarios could change, when changing the initial model parameters describing {IRIS} technology. If {IRIS} could be built near the cities without Emergency Planning Zone ({EPZ}) where a big heat demand is, it could be safely used not only for electricity generation, but also for heat supply for residential and industrial consumers. This will allow not only to reduce energy prices but also to decrease fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.},

This review provides a brief history of relevant {STS} concepts and frameworks and a structured analysis of how {STS} perspectives are appearing in energy social science research and how energy-related research is appearing in social science {STS}. Drawing from an initial body of 262 journal articles and books with a stratified sample of 68 published from 2009 to mid-2019, the review identifies four major groups of perspectives: (1) {STS}-related cultural analysis, especially the study of sociotechnical imaginaries; (2) {STS}-related policy analysis, such as research on the social construction of risks and standards and on the performativity of economic models; (3) {STS} perspectives on public participation processes, expert-public relations, and mobilized publics; and (4) the study of sociotechnical systems, including large technological systems, the politics of design, and users and actor-networks. Connections among the perspectives and the value for energy social science research are also critically discussed.},

This research investigates people’s lived experience and preferences through a nationally representative survey (n = 3000) regarding the energy system, and how these relate to cultural group and other demographics. Our study highlights the influence of cultural background in the {US}, alongside educational achievement and income level on perceptions toward the energy system and energy policy. Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement. For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping. Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers. Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.},

	abstract = {The Texas freeze of February 2021 left more than 4.5 million customers (more than 10 million people) without electricity at its peak, some for several days. The freeze had cascading effects on other services reliant upon electricity including drinking water treatment and medical services. Economic losses from lost output and damage are estimated to be \$130 billion in Texas alone. In the wake of the freeze, there has been major fallout among regulators and utilities as actors sought to apportion blame and utilities and generators began to settle up accounts. This piece offers a retrospective on what caused the blackouts and the knock-on effects on other services, the subsequent financial and political effects of the freeze, and the implications for Texas and the country going forward. Texas failed to sufficiently winterize its electricity and gas systems after 2011. Feedback between failures in the two systems made the situation worse. Overall, the state faced outages of 30 {GW} of electricity as demand reached unprecedented highs. The gap between production and demand forced the non-profit grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ({ERCOT}), to cut off supply to millions of customers or face a systems collapse that by some accounts was minutes away. The 2021 freeze suggests a need to rethink the state’s regulatory approach to energy to avoid future such outcomes. Weatherization, demand response, and expanded interstate interconnections are potential solutions Texas should consider to avoid generation losses, reduce demand, and tap neighboring states’ capacity.},

	abstract = {The importance of spatial resolution for energy modelling has increased in the last years. Incorporating more spatial resolution in energy models presents wide benefits, but it is not straightforward, as it might compromise their computational performance. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of spatial resolution in energy models, including benefits, challenges and future research avenues. The paper is divided in four parts: first, it reviews and analyses the applications of geographic information systems ({GIS}) for energy modelling in the literature. {GIS} analyses are found to be relevant to analyse how meteorology affects renewable production, to assess infrastructure needs, design and routing, and to analyse resource allocation, among others. Second, it analyses a selection of large scale energy modelling tools, in terms of how they can include spatial data, which resolution they have and to what extent this resolution can be modified. Out of the 34 energy models reviewed, 16 permit to include regional coverage, while 13 of them permit to include a tailor-made spatial resolution, showing that current available modelling tools permit regional analysis in large scale frameworks. The third part presents a collection of practices used in the literature to include spatial resolution in energy models, ranging from aggregated methods where the spatial granularity is non-existent to sophisticated clustering methods. Out of the spatial data clustering methods available in the literature, k-means and max-p have been successfully used in energy related applications showing promising results. K-means permits to cluster large amounts of spatial data at a low computational cost, while max-p ensures contiguity and homogeneity in the resulting clusters. The fourth part aims to apply the findings and lessons learned throughout the paper to the North Sea region. This region combines large amounts of planned deployment of variable renewable energy sources with multiple spatial claims and geographical constraints, and therefore it is ideal as a case study. We propose a complete modelling framework for the region in order to fill two knowledge gaps identified in the literature: the lack of offshore integrated system modelling, and the lack of spatial analysis while defining the offshore regions of the modelling framework.},

	abstract = {Most discussions about public resistance to hazardous waste facility siting assume that opponents to the projects—those evincing “not-in-my-backyard” ({NIMBY}) attitudes—have strong environmental values, insufficient or inaccurate knoeledge, and can be assuaged by managerial input or economic benefits. Yet our findings suggest that a person's orientation towards the environment is not a significant factor in opposing these facilities, and that knowledge generally works to polarize differences rather than collapse them. Prescriptions for dilemma revolve around three strategies: education, economic incentives, and inclusion in management. Yet these prescriptions generally do not work as expected, and siting is delayed or scrapped. We propose that the foregoing assumptions are in some ways inaccurate or wrong, and that {NIMBY} attitudes have a stronger basis in core cultural values than more immediate instrumental considerations. The case of nuclear power is used as an analogy, since research has shown clearly that presentation of the issue as one of deficient public accountability by capitalist institutions has proved more effective than alternative explanations evoking environmental quality or economic efficiency. Technical issues, such as those involving nuclear power and hazardous waste, require intermediaries for most people to understand and interpret the issues and relate them to their core values. But while there are many continuities between the two issues, we find that there are still opportunities for public attitudes toward hazardous waste to develop differently.},

	abstract = {Wind and solar electricity generation is projected to expand substantially over the next several decades due both to rapid cost declines as well as regulation designed to achieve climate targets. With increasing reliance on wind and solar generation, future energy systems may be vulnerable to previously underappreciated synoptic-scale variations characterized by low wind and/or surface solar radiation. Here we use western North America as a case study region to investigate the historical meteorology of weekly-scale “droughts” in potential wind power, potential solar power and their compound occurrence. We also investigate the covariability between wind and solar droughts with potential stresses on energy demand due to temperature deviations away human comfort levels. We find that wind power drought weeks tend to occur in late summer and are characterized by a mid-level atmospheric ridge centered over British Columbia and high sea level pressure on the lee side of the Rockies. Solar power drought weeks tend to occur near winter solstice when the seasonal minimum in incoming solar radiation co-occurs with the tendency for mid-level troughs and low pressure systems over the U.S. southwest. Compound wind and solar power drought weeks consist of the aforementioned synoptic pattern associated with wind droughts occurring near winter solstice when the solar resource is at its seasonal minimum. We find that wind drought weeks are associated with high solar power (and vice versa) both seasonally and in terms of synoptic meteorology, which supports the notion that wind and solar power generation can play complementary roles in a diversified energy portfolio at synoptic spatiotemporal scales over western North America.},

                  The premise of this Viewpoint article is that the sustainability of the electricity supply is very often addressed in narrow frames of reference, which sets up incremental decision-making. To more fairly compare the economic, social, and environmental aspects of renewables, such as photovoltaics, to fossil fuels, a broader view is required which needs to take into account the impacts of the fossil fuel supply chain.
               
            
            February 2016 was the warmest February since record keeping began in 1880, and was the warmest month in recorded history (in terms of its deviation from average). May 2016, the warmest May on record, was the 13th consecutive record-breaking month. The Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 has solidified agreement that the world must address climate change, and has resounded the warning that inaction on climate change carries potentially catastrophic risk for the global economy. Electricity generated from renewable energy sources is often compared to fossil fuel energy in terms of economics. Recently there have also been increased calls to incorporate the external costs of electricity generation into the price of electricity. Fossil fuels are largely responsible for global warming (as 85\% of the {CO}2 emissions come from fossil fuel combustion). This Viewpoint article looks at fuel supply chains for oil \& gas, coal, and nuclear in terms of their economics, environmental and social consequences. This reflection upon the historical and present fossil fuel supply chain gives a perspective useful in avoiding limited frames of reference when addressing the consequences of the business-as-usual operation of fossil fuel supply chains.},

Other justice issues relate to extensive contamination in the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, and the mining and processing industries that have supported it. To approach the topic, first we discuss distributional justice issues of {NPP} sites in the U.S. and related procedural injustices in siting, operation, and emergency preparedness. Then we discuss justice concerns involving the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and the ways that uranium mining, processing, and weapons development have affected those living downwind, including a substantial American Indian population. Next we examine the problem of high-level nuclear waste and the risk implications of the lack of secure long-term storage. The handling and deposition of toxic nuclear wastes pose new transgenerational justice issues of unprecedented duration, in comparison to any other industry.

However, a holistic framework for assessing such complex climate change risks has not yet been achieved. Clarity is needed regarding the interactions that generate risk, including the role of adaptation and mitigation responses. In this perspective, we present a framework for three categories of increasingly complex climate change risk that focus on interactions among the multiple drivers of risk, as well as among multiple risks. A significant innovation is recognizing that risks can arise both from potential impacts due to climate change and from responses to climate change. This approach encourages thinking that traverses sectoral and regional boundaries and links physical and socio-economic drivers of risk. Advancing climate change risk assessment in these ways is essential for more informed decision making that reduces negative climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {The decarbonization of energy systems has led to a fundamental change in their topology since generation is shifted to locations with favorable renewable conditions. In planning, this change is reflected by applying optimization models to regions within a country to optimize the distribution of generation units and to evaluate the resulting impact on the grid topology. This paper proposes a globally applicable framework to find a suitable regionalization for energy system models with a data-driven approach. Based on a global, spatially resolved database of demand, generation, and renewable profiles, hierarchical clustering with fine-tuning is performed. This regionalization approach is applied by modeling the resulting regions in an optimization model including a synthesized grid. In an exemplary case study, South Africa’s energy system is examined. The results show that the data-driven regionalization is beneficial compared to the common approach of using political regions. Furthermore, the results of a modeled 80\% decarbonization until 2045 demonstrate that the integration of renewable energy sources fundamentally changes the role of regions within South Africa’s energy system. Thereby, the electricity exchange between regions is also impacted, leading to a different grid topology. Using clustered regions improves the understanding and analysis of regional transformations in the decarbonization process.},

	abstract = {Cities are not only major contributors to global climate change but also stand at the forefront of climate change impact. Quantifying and assessing the risk potentially induced by climate change has great significance for cities to undertake positive climate adaptation and risk prevention. However, most of the previous studies focus on global, national or regional dimensions, only a few have attempted to examine climate change risk at an urban scale and even less in the case of a recent literature review. As a result, a quantitative assessment of climate change risk for cities remains highly challenging. To fill this gap, the article makes a critical review of the recent literature on urban-scale climate change risk assessment, and classifies them into four major categories of studies which jointly constitute a stepwise modelling chain from global climate change towards urban-scale risk assessment. On this basis, the study summarizes the updated research progresses and discusses the major challenges to be overcome for the seamless coupling of climate simulation between different scales, the reproduction of compound climate events, the incorporation of non-market and long-lasting impacts and the representation of risk transmission insides or beyond a city. Furthermore, future directions to advance quantitative assessment of urban-scale climate change risk are highlighted, with fresh insights into improving study methodology, enriching knowledge of climate change impact on city, enhancing abundance and accessibility to data, and exploring the best practice to provide city-specific climate risk service.},

	abstract = {In the face of the broad political call for an “energy turnaround”, we are currently witnessing three essential trends with regard to energy infrastructure planning, energy generation and storage: from planned production towards fluctuating production on the basis of renewable energy sources, from centralized generation towards decentralized generation and from expensive energy carriers towards cost-free energy carriers. These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of previous approaches in using {GIS} in renewable energy-related projects, extracts distinct challenges from these previous efforts and, finally, defines a set of core future research avenues for {GIS}-based energy infrastructure planning with a focus on the use of renewable energy. These future research avenues comprise the availability base data and their “geospatial awareness”, the development of a generic and unified data model, the usage of volunteered geographic information ({VGI}) and crowdsourced data in analysis processes, the integration of 3D building models and 3D data analysis, the incorporation of network topologies into {GIS}, the harmonization of the heterogeneous views on aggregation issues in the fields of energy and {GIS}, fine-grained energy demand estimation from freely-available data sources, decentralized storage facility planning, the investigation of {GIS}-based public participation mechanisms, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, data privacy aspects and, finally, the development of a new dynamic power market design.},

In particular, the integration of weather-dependent renewable energy technologies into energy system optimization models presents new challenges to computational tractability that cannot only be solved by advancements in computational resources. In consequence, energy system modelers must tackle the complexity of their models by applying various methods to manipulate the underlying data and model structure, with the ultimate goal of finding optimal solutions. As which complexity reduction method is suitable for which research question is often unclear, herein we review different approaches for handling complexity. We first analyze the determinants of complexity and note that many drivers of complexity could be avoided a priori with a tailored model design. Second, we conduct a review of systematic complexity reduction methods for energy system optimization models, which can range from simple linearization performed by modelers to sophisticated multi-level approaches combining aggregation and decomposition methods. Based on this overview, we develop a guide for energy system modelers who encounter computational limitations.},

	abstract = {Power sector decarbonization is a central pillar of economy-wide emissions reductions. However, model complexity, especially temporal resolution, can materially impact power sector decarbonization pathways. Using a detailed electric sector capacity planning and dispatch model, this analysis explores impacts of temporal resolution on electric sector investments and costs and how these outcomes vary under different policy and technology assumptions. Results show that approaches to simplify temporal variability used in many integrated assessment and energy system models may not replicate fundamental relationships for power sector decarbonization or may exhibit large quantitative deviations from more detailed modeling, including abatement costs rising nonlinearly at higher decarbonization levels; variable renewables and batteries being accompanied by additional low-/zero-/negative-emissions resources, especially approaching 100\% decarbonization; and carbon removal technologies altering electric sector costs and investments. Representative day approaches can preserve many of these properties with large reductions in computational complexity. Simplified temporal aggregation approaches tend to understate the value of broader technological portfolios, firm low-emitting technologies, wind generation, and energy storage resources and can overstate the value of solar generation. Approximation accuracy also depends on assumptions about technological cost and availability: differences across approaches are smaller when carbon removal is available and when renewables costs are lower. The analysis indicates that higher temporal resolution is increasingly important for policy analysis, electric sector planning, and technology valuation in scenarios with deeper decarbonization and higher variable renewables.},

	title = {Sensitivity and Uncertainty Quantification of Transition Scenario Simulations},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1670703},
	abstract = {This report documents the first collective attempt at developing and applying capabilities to quantify uncertainties, assess parametric sensitivities, and optimize multiple parameters and metrics in fuel cycle simulations generated by the {SA}\&I Campaign. To do this, external codes that were designed to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification ({SA}\&{UQ}) needed to be coupled to the {SA}\&I Campaign’s nuclear fuel cycle simulators ({NFCS}). In {FY}20, two approaches were pursued: 1) coupling Cyclus to an {ORNL}-internal code called {MOT} (Metaheuristic Optimization Tool) and 2) coupling {DYMOND} to the opensource {SA}\&{UQ} tool kit Dakota. The primary objective of having these {NFCS}/{SA}\&{UQ} coupled capabilities is to better inform {DOE}-{NE} and other stakeholders on the results generated from the {NFCS}. For a given set of fuel cycle strategies, policies, and technology assumptions that make up a fuel cycle scenario, these {NFCS} have traditionally been used by the {SA}\&I Campaign to provide quantitative answers in terms of year-by-year mass flows, infrastructure requirements, costs, etc. With these newly developed coupled capabilities, the {SA}\&I Campaign can now efficiently simulate hundreds or thousands of these scenarios, sample large ranges of parameters and assumptions, and use the unique features of the {SA}\&{UQ} tools to process the data. This enables providing answers with known and propagated uncertainties, determining the sensitivity of important metrics to different parameters and assumptions, quantifying how much fuel cycle and technology parameters impact each other, and producing optimized fuel cycle strategies for single and multiple variables. To demonstrate these new capabilities, the Cyclus/{MOT} was used to model several scenarios ranging from simple fleet retirements to transitions to advanced reactors. Specifically, for a transition scenario from {LWRs} to {SFRs} and advanced {LWRs}, uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, and optimization studies were applied to cases involving single and multiple parameter (input) and single and multiple metric (output) variations. In addition, a similar transition scenario was modeled to demonstrate how to optimize the reprocessing capacity parameter to minimize two performance metrics while taking into account uncertainties from two other parameters. Lastly, a depletion module based on {SCALE}/{ORIGEN} was added in Cyclus to simulate the third scenario that was designed to quantify the impact of the modeling assumption that all {LWR} used nuclear fuel have the same burnup. The newly developed {DYMOND}/Dakota capability was also applied to a transition scenario from the existing fleet to small modular reactors and fast reactors. This particular scenario involves not only explicit isotopic depletion via {ORIGEN}-2, but also includes multirecycling and utilizing the criticality search feature to determine the fresh fuel composition of recycled fuel, a feature unique to the {DYMOND} {NFCS}. A large database of simulations were run with 4 main parameters that were sampled: start date of reprocessing, reprocessing capacity, energy demand growth rate, and advanced reactor share of the fleet. The 4 main metrics were uranium consumption, enrichment requirements, waste generation, and levelized cost of electricity using data from the Cost Basis Report. The demonstrated {SA}\&{UQ} results include those that inform on how to choose parameters to avoid “failed” scenarios, Sobol’ indices that inform on the importance of various parameters individually and synergistically, and Analysis of Variance ({ANOVA}) studies that decompose parameter ranges into groups and informs on whether variations are statistically significant.},

The government of Guatemala has introduced a plan to increase renewable generation capacity, while an estimated 76\% of Guatemalans are energy poor. In this paper, we evaluate the trade-offs between alleviating energy poverty and achieving renewable energy goals in Guatemala. We present a framework that combines an electricity cost model with a household expenditure survey to assess the effects that a national renewable energy development goal could have on energy poverty through added electricity expenditures. We find that the development of new renewable electricity generation has potential to significantly increase tariffs for residential electricity consumers across the country, whereby 80\% of municipalities could experience more than one-third increase in monthly energy expenditures. More importantly, we find that the distribution of impacts will not be equal everywhere: households in the western, rural part of Guatemala that are already energy stressed will likely experience the greatest cost burdens because natural resource availability is low while overall poverty is already high. In addition, we compare the costs of renewable versus fossil fuel development and find that the least-cost policy in Guatemala includes a mix of both renewable and fossil technologies.},

Therefore, the “missing money problem” in energy-only electricity markets is more likely to occur in systems with high renewable shares. Nevertheless, renewables are supported in many countries due to their expected benefits. The kind of support instrument can however influence the degree to which renewables influence the market. While fixed feed-in tariffs lead to higher market impacts, more market-oriented support schemes such as market premiums, quota systems and capacity-based payments decrease the extent to which markets are affected. This paper analyzes the market impacts of different support schemes. For this purpose, a new module is added to an existing bottom-up simulation model of the electricity market. In addition, different degrees of flexibility in the electricity system are considered. A case study for Germany is used to derive policy recommendations regarding the choice of support scheme.},

	abstract = {One major avenue for policymakers to meet climate targets is by decarbonizing the power sector, one component of which is raising the share of renewable energy sources (renewables) in electricity generation. However, promoting renewables --in liberalized power markets-- creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100\% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. Ignoring these findings can slow adoption and increase the costs of deploying new renewable technologies. This paper spots the incompatibility between electricity liberalization and renewable policy, regardless of the country, location or renewable technologies. The Paradox holds as long as market clear prices with short term marginal costs, and renewable technology's marginal cost is close to zero and not dispatchable.},

	abstract = {The planning of energy systems with high penetration of renewables is becoming more and more important due to environmental and security issues. On the other hand, high shares of renewables require proper grid integration strategies. In order to overcome these obstacles, the diversification of renewable energy technologies, programmable or not, coupled with different types of storage, daily and seasonal, is recommended. The optimization of the different energy sources is a multi-objective optimization problem because it concerns economical, technical and environmental aspects. The aim of this study is to present the model {EPLANopt}, developed by Eurac Research, which couples the deterministic simulation model {EnergyPLAN} developed by Aalborg University with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm built on the Python library {DEAP}. The test case is the energy system of South Tyrol, for which results obtained through this methodology are presented. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of energy efficiency in buildings. A curve representing the marginal costs of the different energy efficiency strategies versus the annual energy saving is applied to the model through an external Python script. This curve describes the energy efficiency costs for different types of buildings depending on construction period and location.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the behavior of a day-ahead ({DA}) retail electrical energy market with price-based demand response from air conditioning ({AC}) loads through a hierarchical multiagent framework, employing a machine learning approach. At the top level of the hierarchy, a retailer agent buys energy from the {DA} wholesale market and sells it to the consumers. The goal of the retailer agent is to maximize its profit by setting the optimal retail prices, considering the response of the price-sensitive loads. Upon receiving the retail prices, at the lower level of the hierarchy, the {AC} agents employ a Q-learning algorithm to optimize their consumption patterns through modifying the temperature set-points of the devices, considering both consumption costs and users' comfort preferences. Since the retailer agent does not have direct access to the {AC} loads' underlying dynamics and decision process (i.e., incomplete information) the data privacy of the consumers becomes a source of uncertainty in the retailer's decision model. The retailer relies on techniques from the field of machine learning to develop a reliable model of the aggregate behavior of the price-sensitive loads to reduce the uncertainty of the decision-making process. Hence, a multiagent framework based on machine learning enables us to address issues such as interoperability and decision-making under incomplete information in a system that maintains the data privacy of the consumers. We will show that using the proposed model, all the agents are able to optimize their behavior simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to a reduction in overall power consumption cost as the system converges to its equilibrium. This also coincides with maximization in the retailer's profit. We will also show that the same decision architecture can be used to reduce peak load to defer/avoid distribution system upgrades under high penetration of photo-voltaic power in the distribution feeder.},

However, the cost of renewable energy technologies and the reliability of a multi-sources generation system are generally conflicting with each other. This paper presents a multiobjective formulation to allow optimizing simultaneously both the annualized renewable energy cost the system reliability defined as the renewable energy - load disparity ({RELD}). This later takes into account the lack of energy as well as the exceed weighted by a penalty factor. The optimization is reach by acting on the penetration rate of each type of renewable generation technologies in order to satisfy a certain load curve.

A {rNPP} is a {NPP} intentionally designed, sited, interfaced, and operated in a manner to enhance Grid resilience. Four specific {rNPP} applications are discussed: (1) {rNPPs} as “flexible operations” electricity generation assets, (2) {rNPPs} as anchors of nuclear hybrid energy systems, (3) {rNPPs} as Grid Black Start Resources, and (4) {rNPPs} as anchors of Resilient Critical Infrastructure Islands. These four applications, individually and collectively, could enhance U.S. Grid, Critical Infrastructure, and societal resilience during normal conditions and in the wake of major national calamities stemming from natural hazards and/or malevolent human actions. {rNPPs} would be both tactical and strategic resilience assets, thereby extending the value proposition of nuclear energy well beyond that associated with nuclear power’s traditional baseload electricity generation. These are important topics as society grows increasingly dependent on electricity, and the natural hazard and malevolent human threat portfolio to the Grid continues to evolve.},

These conditions drive the need for peak-load power generation, while regulation requirements fuel the push for flexible power generation. The increase of variable renewable energy in the market share, along with falling natural gas prices, makes nuclear power plants less competitive. Thermal storage is being considered to increase the nuclear power plant revenue. Thermal storage increases the flexibility of the nuclear plant system without sacrificing its efficiency. There are multiple opportunities to increase the nuclear power plant revenue, including increased capacity payments, arbitrage, and ancillary services. An economic analysis was performed to investigate the revenue increase of the system with thermal storage. The investment cost was assessed, and net present value was evaluated for the considered scenarios. Two system designs were considered in the analysis: a thermal storage system using the existing power conversion infrastructure and an integrated design with thermal storage fully incorporated into the reactor system design. The preliminary analysis showed that introducing a thermal storage system is profitable for some scenarios considered. Profitability depends significantly on the storage size, output flexibility, share of variable renewable energy, and market characteristics.},

	abstract = {A distributed energy resource ({DER}) system, which can be defined as a medium or small energy conversion and utilization system with various functions for meeting multiple targets, is directly oriented towards users and achieves on-site production and energy supply according to users’ demands. Optimization research on system construction has recently become an important issue. In this paper, simple stochastic mathematical equations were used to interpret the optimal design problem of a {DER} system, and based on this, a novel method for solving the optimization problem, which has multi-dimensional stochastic uncertainties (involving the price of input-energy and energy supply and demand), was put forward. A mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) model was established for the optimal design of the {DER} system by combining the ideas of mean value and variance, aiming to minimize the total costs, including facility costs, energy purchase costs, and loss caused by energy supply shortage, and considering the energy balance and facility performance constraints. In the end, a {DER} system design for an office building district in Xuzhou, China, was taken as an example to verify the model. The influences of uncertainty on the selection of system facilities and the economic evaluation were analyzed. The result indicated that uncertainty of energy demand played a significant role in optimal design, whereas energy price played a negligible role. With respect to economy, if uncertainties are not considered in system design, it will result in a short supply, and therefore the total cost will increase considerably. The calculation convergence was compared with previous work. The implementation results showed the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to study the potential behaviour of a power system with high share of nuclear and less thermal plants, in which variable {RES} insertion increases − for example the French case −, in order to determine the specifications for the design of a potential nuclear reactor with high “manoeuvrability”. Moreover, the flexible reactor may participate more in the supply − demand balance and in particular during large frequency fluctuations caused by the high variability of {RES}. The studies are carried out with the {PowerFactory} software, which make it possible to highlight specific needs regarding the power ramp for an “ideal” flexible nuclear reactor. Using a benchmark network, the Kundur “2 areas-4 machines”, the flexibility requirements are obtained as a function of the grid disturbances. For this purpose, the penetration of variable {RES} is progressively increased, while nuclear power is reduced and thermal power plants are totally suppressed. The study shows that a drop in {RES} production directly impacts the minimal frequency. A faster response speed of nuclear power makes it possible to restore this stability and return to normal operating conditions imposed by the grid operator. This paper describes therefore the process of obtaining the flexibility criterion for different cases of insertion of variable {RES}.},

	abstract = {There is a growing sociopolitical desire to develop cleaner energy sources in the United States and maintain energy security. Regardless of politics, many coal-fired electric plants have already been shut down and many utilities are vowing to retire their current coal-fired assets within the next two decades. Replacement power assets require consideration of appropriate siting. A geographic information system ({GIS})-based multicriteria decision analysis approach is useful to assist utility and energy companies, as well as policymakers, to evaluate potential areas for siting new plants in the contiguous United States. A {GIS}-based framework is simply a database of location information that allows for mapping, querying, modeling, and analyzing data based on location. The spatial output can be structured to be visual, allowing for easier analysis of location data. The need to site additional power assets, including renewable resources and clean power sources, such as nuclear, led to the development of the Oak Ridge Siting Analysis for power Generation Expansion ({OR}-{SAGE}) tool discussed in this paper. The tool takes inputs such as population growth, water availability, environmental indicators, and tec­ tonic and geological hazards to provide an in-depth visual analysis for siting options. Energy companies and other stakeholders can use {OR}-{SAGE} to procure feedback quickly and effectively on land suitability based on technology specific inputs. Policymakers can use {OR}-{SAGE} to analyze the impacts of future energy technology decisions, while balancing competing resource use. This paper discusses the recent use of {OR}-{SAGE} for these purposes and plans for future development.},

	abstract = {Based on an extensive synthesis of semi-structured interviews, media content analysis, and reviews, this article conducts a qualitative meta-analysis of more than 560 sources of evidence to identify 38 visions associated with seven different low-carbon innovations ? automated mobility, electric vehicles, smart meters, nuclear power, shale gas, hydrogen, and the fossil fuel divestment movement ? playing a key role in current deliberations about mobility or low-carbon energy supply and use. From this material, it analyzes such visions based on rhetorical features such as common problems and functions, storylines, discursive struggles, and rhetorical effectiveness. It also analyzes visions based on typologies or degrees of valence (utopian vs. dystopian), temporality (proximal vs. distant), and radicalism (incremental vs. transformative). The article is motivated by the premise that tackling climate change via low-carbon energy systems (and practices) is one of the most significant challenges of the twenty-first century, and that effective decarbonization will require not only new energy technologies, but also new ways of understanding language, visions, and discursive politics surrounding emerging innovations and transitions.},

Firstly, it adds investment models into the review which have not been previously reviewed for decentralized energy modeling. Secondly, a modeling framework consisting of four building blocks is proposed that covers model conceptualization and model operationalization. Thirdly, the relationship between trading mechanisms and model methods is revealed using four evaluation criteria. Furthermore, by reviewing the papers, several trends in the literature are found. Operational models and local markets have been extensively studied, while wholesale market integration and investment models lack scientific attention. Among different trading mechanisms, the usage of bilateral contracts is most commonly seen. Lastly, optimization models significantly outnumber other model methods, and then it follows that their pitfalls such as the scalability of the model and the existence of stable outcomes need to be further addressed in future research.},

With the growth in small and medium-sized agents using solar photovoltaic panels, smart meters, vehicle-to-grid electric automobiles, home batteries and other ‘smart’ devices, prosuming offers the potential for consumers and vehicle owners to re-evaluate their energy practices. As the number of prosumers increases, the electric utility sector of today is likely to undergo significant changes over the coming decades, offering possibilities for greening of the system, but also bringing many unknowns and risks that need to be identified and managed. To develop strategies for the future, policymakers and planners need knowledge of how prosumers could be integrated effectively and efficiently into competitive electricity markets. Here we identify and discuss three promising potential prosumer markets related to prosumer grid integration, peer-to-peer models and prosumer community groups. We also caution against optimism by laying out a series of caveats and complexities.},

	abstract = {Community-based energy systems are gaining traction among policymakers and practitioners as promising models for implementing a low-carbon energy transition. As a result, there has been a proliferation of concepts in the scientific literature, such as community energy, energy communities, community solar, and community wind. However, what scholars mean by “community” in these contexts is often unclear and inconsistent. This paper provides further conceptual clarity in the field by analyzing how the term of community is conceptualized in the scholarly literature on energy systems, through a systematic review of 405 articles. We combine an author keyword network analysis of this corpus with an in-depth analysis of 183 definitions extracted from these articles and systematically coded across three dimensions: meanings, activities and objectives of communities. Our findings show that the meanings attached to the notion of community and the alleged objectives pursued by communities vary substantially across concepts and over time. In particular, there has been a shift away from a notion of community understood as a process that emphasizes participatory aspects toward a notion of com­ munity primarily referring to a place. Furthermore, there is a growing focus on communities’ economic objec­ tives rather than their social or political goals. These findings suggest a weakening of scholars’ attention to “transformative” notions of community emphasizing collective and grassroots processes of participation in en­ ergy transitions, to the benefit of “instrumental” notions. This trend runs the risk of placing the sole emphasis on the market value of communities, thereby diluting their distinctiveness from more commercial actors.},

Focusing particularly upon the contestation over nuclear energy, it challenges eco-modernist claims that technological innovation can bypass political disagreement and smoothly facilitate the shift to a more sustainable form of life in an era of ecological crisis. The article advocates an “ecological agonistic” approach that refuses to regard such contestation as an impediment to robust and radical transformation. Instead, it suggests that the conflicts over nuclear energy reveal the limitations and lacunae of existing social, economic, and political institutions and thus can be understood as themselves playing a salutary role in their transformation.},

This paper introduces the Electricity Markets and Investment Suite - Agent-Based Simulation ({EMIS}-{AS}), which models the evolution of the electricity generation mix under various market structures while explicitly capturing the aforementioned investment factors and imperfect information. {EMISAS} advances the state-of-the-art of generation expansion planning and agent-based modeling by incorporating various aspects of investor heterogeneity (e.g., differences in financial characteristics, technology preferences, and attitudes towards risk under uncertainty), a robust price prediction methodology, a methodology for updating investors’ forecast parameters using Kalman Filters, and endogenous representation of a customizable set of wholesale electricity markets including energy, ancillary services, capacity, and renewable energy certificate markets. Implementation of {EMIS}-{AS} on a test system highlights the strong role that firms’ heterogeneous attributes have on the investment decisions, generation portfolio, and resulting resource adequacy. In multiple instances, investment and retirement results diverge not only due to each firm’s own parameters, but also due to the actions and characteristics of other firms. Results also demonstrate how imperfect information and risk preferences can lead to suboptimal investment outcomes, which can require firm-level recourse actions with severe profitability implications. In addition, a comparison with a traditional generation expansion planning model highlights the ability of {EMIS}-{AS} to capture resource scarcity and early retirements caused by real-world imperfections that traditional models cannot represent.},

We begin by articulating a set of overarching principles that can be used to guide {ESOM}-based analysis. To help operationalize the guiding principles, we outline and explain critical steps in the modelling process, including how to formulate research questions, set spatio-temporal boundaries, consider appropriate model features, conduct and refine the analysis, quantify uncertainty, and communicate insights. We highlight the need to develop and refine formal guidance on {ESOM} application, which comes at a critical time as {ESOMs} are being used to inform national climate targets.},

However, their deployment has moral implications, for example regarding data privacy, user autonomy, or distribution of responsibilities. ‘Energy justice’ is one of the most comprehensive frameworks to address these implications, but remains limited regarding smart grids, and regarding concrete guidelines for designers and policymakers. In this paper, we fill this gap by answering the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through electricity sector regulation.},

Despite some efforts in unifying different types of mono-objective evolutionary and non-{EAs}, researchers are not interested enough in unifying all three types of optimization problems together. Such a unified algorithm will allow users to work with a single software enabling one-time implementation of solution representation, operators, objectives, and constraints formulations across several objective dimensions. For the first time, we propose a unified evolutionary optimization algorithm for solving all three classes of problems specified above, based on the recently proposed elitist, guided nondominated sorting procedure, developed for solving many-objectives problems. Using a new niching-based selection procedure, our proposed unified algorithm automatically degenerates to an efficient equivalent population-based algorithm for each class. No extra parameters are needed. Extensive simulations are performed on unconstrained and constrained test problems having single-, two-, multi-, and many-objectives and on two engineering optimization design problems. Performance of the unified approach is compared to suitable population-based counterparts at each dimensional level. Results amply demonstrate the merit of our proposed unified approach and motivate similar studies for a richer understanding of the development of optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are often assumed as positive phenomena, because they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance, there is evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an “energy justice” framework consisting of four distinct dimensions—distributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions—nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany—through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert participants as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve large internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.},

	shorttitle = {Enabling assessment of distributive justice through models for climate change planning},
	abstract = {Models for supporting climate adaptation and mitigation planning, mostly in the form of Integrated Assessment Models, are poorly equipped for aiding questions related to fairness of adaptation and mitigation strategies, because they often disregard distributional outcomes. When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

However, there has been less systematic reflection on the research conducted so far, its scope or contribution, nor what it might mean for the future of the concept. To provide insights, this paper presents the results of a systematic and comprehensive review of 155 peer-reviewed articles published across eight databases between January 2008 and December 2019. The aim is firstly to review the current state of the art in the energy justice literature and, secondly, to present findings that support novel recommendations with the potential to enhance the impact of energy justice research, including applications in the economic and planning policy sectors. Critically, our study demonstrates that the literature lacks diversity in its author basis and research design. By contrast, conceptual frameworks and the geographies and technologies of global energy injustice are proliferating. These results illustrate that energy justice has power and agency as a tool. It can act as a protagonist in energy research, provoking researchers to remain reflexively normative and active in identifying injustices and vulnerabilities, and it can act as a promising progenitor, creating new research methods and themes.},

As the social dimensions of energy systems are becoming more salient, it is time to reflect on what has been achieved, and look towards a future of greater impact and transdisciplinary methods in energy justice research and practice. In the past 10 years, the energy justice literature has grown exponentially demonstrating the appeal and the value of its tangible, applicable explanatory framework. Yet more pessimistically, this rapid growth could also represent a trend in uncritical commitment without appropriate reflectivity and without maximizing societal impact. Carefully considering these different interpretations, this perspective article reflects on four core challenges and opportunities for energy justice scholarship and practice in its next wave of development: (1) the alignment, connectivity and orientation of energy justice terminology, (2) leveraging impact and achieving outcomes in partnership between academic and non-academic communities and activists, (3) the need to acknowledge and define the audience for energy justice contributions and (4) the need for energy justice scholars and practitioners to “practice what we preach”. Given the timely salience of energy justice work, more intentional consideration of the possibilities for societal impact is increasingly valuable.},

Cities are promising leverage points to facilitate system transitions by promoting local innovation and policy experimentation. Building on transition management, we developed a knowledge base for the imple­ mentation of transition experiments to reduce city-level car use. From screening nearly 800 peer-reviewed studies and case studies, including in-depth analysis of 24 documents that met quality criteria and quantita­ tively estimated car use reduction, we identify 12 intervention types combining different measures and policy instruments that were effective in reducing car use in European cities. The most effective at reducing overall car use were the Congestion Charge, Parking \& Traffic Congrol, and Limited Traffic Zone. Most interventions were led by local government, planned and decided in collaboration with different urban stakeholders. We evaluated the potential of the identified intervention types to be implemented in a pilot study of Lund, Sweden, using three criteria from Transition Management of novelty, feasibility, and suitability, as assessed by interviews with local experts. We recommend three transition experiments to reduce local car use in Lund: Parking and Traffic Control, Workplace Parking Charge, and Mobility Services for Commuters. We suggest practitioners follow our method to identify effective and locally suitable interventions to reduce car use, and future research quantify the effec­ tiveness of interventions to reduce car use using the standardised outcome measure of daily passenger kilometres travelled by car.},

	abstract = {The optimal design of off-grid microgrids in developing countries is difficult to achieve, as several political and socio-economic risks can hamper investments of private companies. Estimating the energy demand and its growth is a challenging task, subject to high uncertainty that rarely have been accounted for in multi-year simulations at hourly resolution. Besides, from a long-term perspective, the assets degradation can signifi­ cantly affect the performance of stand-alone hybrid energy systems. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a novel stochastic dynamic method to size microgrids, simulating with accuracy the system oper­ ation and considering the unavoidable uncertainty in load growth and the components ageing. A predefined scenario tree structure allows capturing the load growth uncertainty and obtaining different capacity expansion strategies for each scenario. An illustrative case study for an isolated power system in Kenya using data collected in 23 Kenyan microgrids is shown. The proposed stochastic formulation results in a considerable reduction of the size of components with respect to traditional single-year approaches. Savings in terms of Net Present Cost ({NPC}) are beyond 16-20\% and the effects of assets degradation are about 6\%. Results lead to recommend multi-year optimization tools, as single-year methodologies can hardly achieve the same performances.},

The solution of this problem belongs to the ﬁeld of non-linear combinatorial multiobjective optimisation. In a multiobjective optimisation problem, the target is not to ﬁnd an optimal solution, but a set of non-dominated solutions called Pareto-set. The present article considers as an economic objective the minimisation of system’s cost of energy ({COE}), whereas the environmental objective is the minimisation of the total greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions of the system during its lifetime. The main novelty of this article is that the calculation of {GHG} emissions is based on life cycle analysis ({LCA}) of each system’s component. In {LCA}, the whole life cycle emissions of a component are taken into account, from raw materials extraction to ﬁnal disposal/recycling. This article adopts the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}), which in combination with a proposed local search procedure effectively solves the multiobjective optimisation problem of {SAHPS}. Two main categories of {SAHPS} are examined with different energy storage: lead-acid batteries and hydrogen storage. The results indicate the superiority of batteries under both economic and environmental criteria.},

To provide guidance for a regional market design in China, this study develops an optimization model to simulate the power system operation results of an integrated regional market, and compares the actual operating costs with the optimized costs to obtain economic benefits from market integration. Three allocation mechanisms are designed to allocate the benefits. The market integration of China Southern Grid region in 2017 is employed as a case study and the major conclusions achieved are that: (1) The total economic gains from electricity market integration are {US}\$ 5.34 billion, representing 16\% of the actual operational cost in the China Southern Grid region. (2) Hydropower generation has the greatest impact on the integration benefits, while the capacity of cross-border transmission lines has the least impact. (3) The results of benefits allocation under the mechanisms of Equal share, Shapley value and Raiffa value vary substantially, and a good balance of the equity and feasibility is needed in designing the benefits allocation mechanisms. These obtained results confirm the fact that market integration will contribute to larger benefits with a fair allocation mechanism, thus deserving to be implemented during the current round of electricity market reform in China.},

This paper therefore combines examination of perceptions and awareness of general public (web-based questionnaire) and top energy experts (a Delphi survey) on the energy supply network and identifies their potential integration in energy supply decision making processes. The results showed that public should be better informed as well as integrated into designing energy supply network as the prosumers gain power and the energy suppliers will no longer dominate the market. Public actors are ready to shape sustainable energy supply and also willing to pay 5.8\% more for a sustainable energy supply. The majority are prepared to invest in renewable energy supply network close to their place of residence. Another result is that the public is calling for a shift in priority towards more sustainable and socially friendlier energy supply rather than focusing mainly on the economic and technical perspectives.},

	abstract = {Energy justice is now an established research topic in the field of energy policy. Despite the growing popularity of energy justice research, however, conceptual and analytical frameworks used in the field have remained limited. This paper reviews the prevailing three-tenet framework of energy justice which has shaped the current discourse based on the three dimensions—distributional, procedural, and recognition justice. As an effort to contribute to expanding the research agenda of energy justice problems, we propose a new understanding of the production of energy injustice by characterizing three institutionalized tendencies of dominant modern energy systems: (1) preference for large-scale technical systems and distancing of system designs from local decision-making processes, (2) centralization of energy production and concomitant distancing of supply from users, and (3) widespread ‘risk-taking’ tendencies portrayed by designers and proponents of current energy supply systems as a necessary ‘price to pay’ for technological innovation and social progress. We then connect these three tendencies to political, economic, and technical ideologies of modernism that often provide justifications for energy inequity: (1) top-down political and economic decision-making systems, (2) technical interpretation of sustainability, (3) specialist understanding of fairness, and (4) path dependency in the modern energy paradigm. Finally, we present an illustration of how this new conception of systemic energy injustice can be applied in practice using the case of South Korea's nuclear power system and Seoul's One Less Nuclear Power Plant Initiative.},

Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

	abstract = {Microgrids operating on renewable energy resources have potential for powering rural areas located far from existing grid infrastructures. These small power systems typically host a hybrid energy system of diverse architecture and size. An effective integration of renewable energies resources requires careful design. Sizing methodologies often lack the consideration for reliability and this aspect is limited to power adequacy. There exists an inherent trade-off between renewable integration, cost, and reliability. To bridge this gap, a sizing methodology has been developed to perform multi-objective optimization, considering the three design objectives mentioned above. This method is based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}) that returns the set of optimal solutions under all objectives. This method aims to identify the trade-offs between renewable integration, reliability, and cost allowing to choose the adequate architecture and sizing accordingly. As a case study, we consider an autonomous microgrid, currently being installed in a rural area in Mali. The results show that increasing system reliability can be done at the least cost if carried out in the initial design stage.},

	abstract = {The Paris Agreement does not only stipulate to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C, it also calls for ‘making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions’. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand the implications of climate targets for energy systems and quantify the associated investment requirements in the coming decade. A meaningful analysis must however consider the near-term mitigation requirements to avoid the overshoot of a temperature goal. It must also include the recently observed fast technological progress in key mitigation options. Here, we use a new and unique scenario ensemble that limit peak warming by construction and that stems from seven up-to-date integrated assessment models. This allows us to study the near-term implications of different limits to peak temperature increase under a consistent and up-to-date set of assumptions. We find that ambitious immediate action allows for limiting median warming outcomes to well below 2 °C in all models. By contrast, current nationally determined contributions for 2030 would add around 0.2 °C of peak warming, leading to an unavoidable transgression of 1.5 °C in all models, and 2 °C in some. In contrast to the incremental changes as foreseen by current plans, ambitious peak warming targets require decisive emission cuts until 2030, with the most substantial contribution to decarbonization coming from the power sector. Therefore, investments into low-carbon power generation need to increase beyond current levels to meet the Paris goals, especially for solar and wind technologies and related system enhancements for electricity transmission, distribution and storage. Estimates on absolute investment levels, up-scaling of other low-carbon power generation technologies and investment shares in less ambitious scenarios vary considerably across models. In scenarios limiting peak warming to below 2 °C, while coal is phased out quickly, oil and gas are still being used significantly until 2030, albeit at lower than current levels. This requires continued investments into existing oil and gas infrastructure, but investments into new fields in such scenarios might not be needed. The results show that credible and effective policy action is essential for ensuring efficient allocation of investments aligned with medium-term climate targets.},

	abstract = {Government plans and initiatives for the 50 largest U.S. cities were examined for connections between social equity and sustainability. Six sectors that are associated with sustainability (defined as the sector’s potential to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions) were included: buildings, electricity, food, greenspace, pollution and air quality, and transportation. The study identified 261 plans and initiatives in the 50 cities during the 2010–2020 period that had connections between social equity and sustainability. Results indicate that cities still have many opportunities to improve plans and initiatives when undertaking revisions. To that end, 21 types of goals and initiatives are identified from the data set to show a composite picture of how cities can integrate social equity with sustainability in this area. Of the 21 types, only 7 appeared in more than 50\% of the cities. The study also provides an analysis of opportunities for robust engagement, implementation, equity tracking, and connections of goals across sectors. An additional analysis shows that cities with greater attention to the sustainability-equity nexus tend to lean toward the center-left Democratic Party, to have higher education and income, and to have sustainability offices.},

Our relative energy poverty metric, the energy equity gap, is defined as the difference in the inflection temperatures between low and high-income groups. In our study region, we estimate the energy equity gap to be between 4.7–7.5 °F (2.6–4.2 °C). Within a sample of 4577 households, we found 86 energy-poor and 214 energy-insecure households. In contrast, the income-based energy poverty metric, energy burden (10\% threshold), identified 141 households as energy-insecure. Only three households overlap between our energy equity gap and the income-based measure. Thus, the energy equity gap reveals a hidden but complementary aspect of energy poverty and insecurity.},

Equity is highlighted in the Biden-Harris January 2021 Executive Order No. 13,985, “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities” (Exec. Order (2021)). When applied to the energy \& utilities sector, ”energy equity” refers to the condition in which energy is provided to all in a consistent and systematically fair, just, and impartial manner regardless of race, geography, social standing, or economic position. Following this definition, energy equity is fundamental to healthy and prosperous social and economic systems, and contributes to regional and national security and stability. Data show that underserved populations generally suffer disproportionately from power outages, high energy prices, and polluting energy generation facilities. Numerous policy measures that include energy storage (i.e., residential, commercial, and utility scale batteries, and other technologies) can help provide energy equity to all populations. These policy measures address procurement mandates, replacement of peaker units, financial incentives, ownership policies and community projects, integrated resource planning and pilot programs, resilience, and long duration energy storage.},

	abstract = {Recent academic evidence suggests that, in contrast to what is often thought, the introduction of renewable energy infrastructures often leads to negative, not positive, social equity outcomes. Against this background, this paper aims to develop and empirically illustrate an integrative framework for analysing the work – or ‘agency’ – exercised by actors operating within and across different global contexts to align renewable energy and social equity. To this end, the paper first reviews three generative conceptions of agency in the energy transitions literature: institutional work, imaginaries and energy justice. In reviewing their explanatory power as well as their shortcomings, the paper concludes that these different conceptions of agency can be integrated meaningfully in an expanded conceptualisation of institutional work that spans three distinct domains: i) ‘reimagining’, ii) ‘recoding’ and iii) ‘reconfiguring’. This article demonstrates that the three domains can be understood to reiteratively feed into each other in what we call the ‘triple re-cycle’. These iterations produce either bolstering effects that strengthen the potential for positive social equity outcomes or evaporative effects that diminish or undermine this potential. We empirically illustrate the framework in case studies from Germany and South Africa. Overall, we argue that the triple re-cycle, as a heuristic, can provide new insights by conceptually connecting multiple domains of agency in energy transitions, including discursive and material aspects, across different global contexts. Our hope is that identifying potential agency in this way supports work to improve the social equity outcomes of energy transitions globally.},

However, the impact of capacity expansion of renewables on the sustainability dimensions has not been rigor­ ously assessed for the Indian scenario. In this perspective, the present research investigates the optimal capacity installation of renewables using a proposed modelling framework. The framework encompasses a multi-objective optimization model interlinked to a sustainability model. This work develops a simplified temporally resolved electricity model of India to explore nine broad scenarios. The Pareto front solutions are ranked under a set of decision-maker preference scenarios across six sustainability metrics, including economic dispatchability, emission, water-use, land-use, safety, and employment. Results indicate a possibility of 25.5\%–41.2\% of renewable penetration by 2030. The Pareto frontiers with a higher share of onshore wind, utility solar photo­ voltaic, and dammed hydro are among the top-ranked solutions. High river hydro supported by high levels of offshore wind can significantly contribute to low carbon generation without overshooting the upfront cost. Overall, the electricity mix with the least coal power generation of 1175 {TWh}/yr estimates to be the most sustainable solution. This paper addresses the sensitivity to changes in input lifetime year and cost assumptions; output shows considerable robustness of annual system costs to the lifetime of technologies and higher sensitivity to utility solar and onshore wind costs.},

Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.},

But in planning such a transition, it is common to consider primarily cost and greenhouse gas reduction, as typified by cost-mitigation curves that have become widespread. Such assessments tend to leave important considerations of energy justice on the periphery. This paper puts forward an alternative assessment technique, incorporating various indicators of social equity in order to assess the priority of power plant replacement that would lead to the greatest improvement in benefits, while placing the burden of system changes away from the most vulnerable. An example of the application of this approach is presented for prioritization of the retirement and replacement (with {RE}) of Australia s ageing fleet of coal-fired power plants. The assessment shows very different results from a standard cost-mitigation approach, with the retirement of the large brown coal power plants (including the recently retired Hazelwood power plant) and the replacement with wind power (where applicable) promoting the best overall outcomes on both cost and equity. Considering a selection of high priority indicators with many locally-specific data sets, the approach adds significant contextual relevance to prioritization, and is considered to offer useful findings for policy-makers.},

Drawing on the strengths of both sets of literature, we argue that a comprehensive approach requires analyses to account for the co-evolution of institutional change, material change and relational change, with a cross-cutting concern for multiple spatialities and normative implications. We then illustrate this approach through three brief case studies of multi-scalar solar uptake in Portugal, bringing out how justice considerations are intricately involved in the practices and politics of these concrete, broadly representative instances of sustainable energy transitions.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of spatial justice and inequality to understandings of energy poverty and vulnerability. By applying an explicitly spatial lens to conceptualize energy poverty as a form of injustice, it contributes to debates in the domain of ‘energy justice’, where previous examinations of energy deprivation through a justice framing have focused on inequalities between social groups and often marginalized questions of spatial difference. We start from the premise that geographic disparities in the risk and incidence of domestic energy deprivation are a key component of energy justice. An extensive literature review has allowed us to highlight the spatial and temporal variation of cross-sectoral and entire-energy-chain injustices that lead to elevated energy poverty risks. These processes contribute to the rise of energy injustices via four mechanisms – which we term landscapes of material deprivation, geographic underpinnings of energy affordability, vicious cycles of vulnerability, and spaces of misrecognition – operating at a multiplicity of scales. While lending some support to area-based approaches towards energy poverty alleviation, our findings also suggest that such policies alone may marginalize the underlying structural dynamics that (re)produce spatial inequalities. Therefore, achieving energy justice necessitates broader interventions in the fundamental driving forces of spatial inequality.},

Nothing like the conscious system-wide change required has been attempted before. Rapid policy decisions risk embedding existing injustices or creating new ones unless steps are taken to ameliorate those risks. We present a model that takes a whole-system view of the {UK} spatial economy, examining how increasing distance costs (e.g. through fuel tax hikes) have unequal impacts on regions and sectors. The model establishes an important carbon transition policy principle: change in spatial flows of internal trade, which are certain to occur rapidly during transition, have measurable energy justice implications. Peripheral economic regions, in rural and coastal areas and many city outskirts are most vulnerable, as are petrochemical, agricultural and connected sectors. Policy must go beyond identifying places and sectors most affected: it is the connections between them that matter most. The "push" of spatially aware fiscal policy needs to be combined with the "pull" of targeted interventions designed to promote low-carbon intermediate connections. This is not only just, but would help make (potentially costly) transition more politically acceptable.},

Purpose:
To provide a detailed analysis of the issues and concerns related to public transportation in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and describe how coalition-building was used to influence positive change in transportation policy.

Key Points:
Members from various organizations aligned with local transit riders to create the Transportation Coalition and advocate for extended night and weekend services for the Winston-Salem public transportation system.

Conclusions:
Partnerships between community-based organizations are crucial to identifying and addressing the needs of a community. The Transportation Coalition will continue its work in local public transportation policy. A long-term policy objective is fare-free transit on the city bus system.},

	shorttitle = {Quantifying the social equity state of an energy system},
	abstract = {A fundamental societal concern in energy system transitions is the distribution of benefits and costs across populations. A recent transition, the {US} shale gas boom, has dramatically altered the domestic energy outlook and global markets; however, the social equity implications have not been meaningfully assessed and accounted for in public and private decision making. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a systematic approach to quantify the multi-dimensional equity state of an energy system, with a focus on the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin. We tailor variants of standard equity metrics as well as develop new empirical and analytical methods and metrics to assess spatial, temporal, income, and racial equity as it relates to air quality, climate change, and labor market impacts across the natural gas supply chain. We find moderate to high spatial inequities with respect to the distribution of production (Gini coefficient (η) = 0.93), consumption for electric power generation (η = 0.68), commercial, industrial, and residential end use (η = 0.72), job creation (η = 0.72), and air pollution-related deaths (η = 0.77), which are largely driven by geographically-fixed natural gas abundance and demand. Air quality impacts are also regressive, such that mortality risk induced by natural gas activity generally increases as income decreases; for example, mortality risk (m) (in units of premature mortality per 100 000 people) for the lowest income class ({\textless}\$15 000; m = 0.22 in 2016) is higher (18\%–31\%) than for the highest income class ({\textgreater}\$150 000; m = 0.27 in 2016). These risks are higher for white (m = 0.30 in 2016) than non-white (m = 0.16 in 2016) populations, which is largely a result of the demographics of rural communities within the vicinity of natural gas development. With respect to local labor market impacts within producing counties, we find marginal declines in income inequality (2.8\% ± 1.0\%) and poverty rates (9.9\% ± 1.7\%) during the boom, although household income increases for the wealthiest and decreases for the poorest. At a systems-level, there is an implied air quality-employment tradeoff of 3 ({\textless}1 to 7) job-years created per life-year lost; this tradeoff varies spatially (−1100 to 4400 life-years lost minus job-years created), wherein the job benefit outweighs the air quality costs in most producing counties whereas in all other counties the reverse is true. We also observe temporal inequities, with air quality and employment impacts following the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts are largely borne by future generations. Cross-impact elasticities (ε), which measure the sensitivity between different types of impacts, reveal that employment increases are sensitive to and coupled with increases in air and climate impacts (ε = 1.1 and ε = 1.3, respectively). The metrics applied here facilitate the evaluation and design of countervailing policies and systems that explicitly account for social inequities mediated through energy infrastructure, supply, and demand. For example, in future energy system transition, such equity metrics can be used to facilitate decisions related to the siting of low-carbon infrastructure such as transmission lines and wind turbines and the phase-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as to demonstrate changes in distributional tradeoffs such as the decoupling of environmental and employment effects.},

Within this paper, such a bottom-up shortterm model which simultaneously implements (i) hourly temporal resolution, (ii) multi-node approach thus high spatial resolution, (iii) integrates the electric, thermal and transport sectors and (iv) implements a multi-objective investment optimization method is proposed. The developed method is applied to the Italian energy system at 2050 to test and show its main features. The model allows the evaluation of the hourly curtailments for each node. The optimization highlights that the cheapest solutions work towards high curtailments and low investments in flexibility options.

@report{clemmer_nuclear_2018,
	title = {The Nuclear Power Dilemma},
	abstract = {For decades, nuclear power has provided most of the
nation’s carbon-free electricity. However, the owners
have shut down many nuclear plants in the last five
years or announced plans to close them well before
their operating licenses expire, generating a discussion
among policymakers and regulators about the impact
of early retirements. The primary reasons for these
early closures are the economic challenges brought on
by cheap natural gas, diminished demand for
electricity, falling costs for renewable energy, rising
operating costs, and safety and performance problems.
The possibility that the nation will replace existing
nuclear plants with natural gas and coal rather than
low-carbon sources raises serious concerns about our
ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions
needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.
 As of the end of 2017, 99 reactors at 60 power
plants provided 20 percent of {US} electricity
generation. The owners have retired six reactors at five
plants since 2013, slated seven reactors at five more
plants to retire over the next eight years, and
threatened to close five reactors at four more plants in
the next few years if they do not receive new financial
support.1
 In addition, Illinois, New Jersey, and New
York now provide financial support to keep 10 reactors at seven plants operating for at least 10 more years.
 The economic challenges facing nuclear plants are
part of a historic transition in the {US} electricity sector.
Over the last decade, natural gas generation and
renewable energy generation from wind and solar have
grown rapidly as their prices have fallen. Combined
with investments in energy efficiency, these energy
sources have largely replaced generation from retiring
coal plants, resulting in a 28 percent reduction in {US}
power-sector emissions of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) below
2005 levels in 2017. While nuclear power’s share of
electric power production has remained relatively flat
over the past decade, most analysts project that share
to decline in the future without additional financial or
policy support.
 The transition already has resulted in many
benefits, including lower electricity prices, technological innovation, a cleaner environment, and increased
customer control over energy use. However, in the
absence of national policy to reduce carbon emissions,
the transition has undervalued all types of low-carbon
sources of electricity and underpriced natural gas and
coal relative to their damage to the climate.
 The Union of Concerned Scientists ({UCS}) has
assessed the economic viability and performance of
most of the nuclear power plants operating in the
United States, analyzing which ones are most at risk of
early retirement and evaluating the main factors that
affect competitiveness. We also identified reactors that
have been safe, reliable performers and those with
troubled performance records. In addition, using a
national model of the electricity sector, {UCS} has
analyzed the impacts on the {US} electricity mix, {CO}2
emissions, and consumer electricity bills of three
scenarios for retiring nuclear plants early and two
scenarios based on the introduction of national policies
to reduce carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {A reliable and cost-effective electricity system transition requires both the identification of optimal target states and the definition of political and regulatory frameworks that enable these target states to be achieved. Fundamental optimization models are frequently used for the determination of cost-optimal system configurations. They represent a normative approach and typically assume markets with perfect competition. However, it is well known that real systems do not behave in such an optimal way, as decision-makers do not have perfect information at their disposal and real market actors do not take decisions in a purely rational way. These deficiencies lead to increased costs or missed targets, often referred to as an “efficiency gap”. For making rational political decisions, it might be valuable to know which factors influence this efficiency gap and to what extent. In this paper, we identify and quantify this gap by soft-linking a fundamental electricity market model and an agent-based simulation model, which allows the consideration of these effects. In order to distinguish between model-inherent differences and non-ideal market behavior, a rigorous harmonization of the models was conducted first. The results of the comparative analysis show that the efficiency gap increases with higher renewable energy shares and that information deficits and policy instruments affect operational decisions of power market participants and resulting overall costs significantly.},

In Germany, for instance, the feed-in tariff legislation for renewables has been successively replaced by first optional and then obligatory marketing of {RES} on competitive wholesale markets. This paper introduces an agent-based model that allows studying the impact of changing energy policy instruments on the economic performance of {RES} operators and marketers. The model structure, its components, and linkages are presented in detail; an additional case study demonstrates the capability of our sociotechnical model. We find that changes in the political framework cannot be mapped directly to {RES} operators as behaviour of intermediary market actors has to be considered as well. Characteristics and strategies of intermediaries are thus an important factor for successful {RES} marketing and further deployment. It is shown that the model is able to assess the emergence and stability of market niches.},

Using data for recentlyinstalled systems, we estimate the balance of beneﬁts and costs associated with installing a nonutility solar {PV} system today. We also study the geographical distribution of the various subsidies that are made available to owners of rooftop solar {PV} systems, and compare it to distributions of population and income. We ﬁnd that, after accounting for federal subsidies and local rebates and assuming a discount rate of 7\%, the private beneﬁts of new installations will exceed private costs only in seven of the 19 states for which we have data and only if customers can sell excess power to the electric grid at the retail price. These states are characterized by abundant sunshine (California, Texas and Nevada) or by high electricity prices (New York). Public beneﬁts from reduced air pollution and climate change impact exceed the costs of the various subsidies offered system owners for less than 10\% of the systems installed, even assuming a 2\% discount rate. Subsidies ﬂowed disproportionately to counties with higher median incomes in 2006. In 2014, the distribution of subsidies was closer to that of population income, but subsidies still ﬂowed disproportionately to the better-off. The total, upfront, subsidy per kilowatt of installed capacity has fallen from \$5200 in 2006 to \$1400 in 2014, but the absolute magnitude of subsidy has soared as installed capacity has grown explosively. We see considerable differences in the balance of costs and beneﬁts even within states, indicating that local factors such as system price and solar resource are important, and that policies (e.g. net metering) could be made more efﬁcient by taking local conditions into account.},

	abstract = {How can leaders successfully craft energy or climate policy to support an initiative that citizens oppose? This paper considers this challenge from a change management perspective applied to public governance. It ﬁrst draws on change management theory to develop a framework for altering mass public perspectives. The framework consists of four phases: i) problematizing the issue, ii) laying a foundation for change, iii) reshaping perspectives, and iv) entrenching support. Drawing from the insights gleaned from the establishment of Japan's nuclear power program, the paper further argues that in order to succeed in mass perceptual change, policymakers must ﬁrst clearly understand the contextual environment in which the policy is being formulated. In doing so, policymakers will be better able to customize policy design to appeal to stakeholder perceptions and sentiments. Although the context of this paper is the perceptual modiﬁcation of public opinion to support nuclear power, the authors suggest that the same framework can be applied to perceptual modiﬁcation of any policy that the general public might be opposed to. In the energy sector, this could apply to fostering a transition to renewable energy as easily as it applies to nurturing nuclear power development. However, the Japanese case puts forth a caveat in this regard, there is evidence that the mindsets of the Japanese policymakers were predisposed to advocacy of nuclear power and once policymakers commit to a technological trajectory, it is hard to engender a change of course. Therefore, the article concludes by speculating on how the perceptions of policymakers might be similarly altered through eﬀorts from the alternative energy sector to foster policy change.},

In this study, we quantify the trade-oﬀs between cost-eﬃcient (least-cost) and regionally equitable {DREG} allocation in terms of electricity generation costs, investment needs, and {DREG} capacity requirements. Using the case of the ambitious and publicly-approved Swiss Energy Strategy 2050, we set up a bottom-up, technology-rich electricity system model {EXPANSE} with Modeling to Generate Alternatives at a spatial resolution of 2’258 Swiss municipalities. In order to measure regional equity implication, we adapt the concepts of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coeﬃcient. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant trade-oﬀ by 2035 in Switzerland: 50\% increase in regional equity when allocating {DREG} to various Swiss regions on the basis of population or electricity demand leads to 18\% higher electricity generation costs. Least-cost allocation implies concentrating {DREG} and associated investments to few most productive locations only. Solar {PV} is the key technology for increasing regional equity. We conclude that in countries with spatially-uneven {DREG} resources like Switzerland, any policies that focus on cost eﬃciency should anticipate regional equity implications in advance and, if desired, minimize them by promoting solar {PV}.},

We combine multiple methods, including legal analysis, economic and energy modelling, monetary valuation and numerical optimization. We find that minimum distances between renewable power plants and human settlements should be as small as is legally possible. Even small reductions in efficiency lead to large increases in equity. By considering electricity grid expansion costs, we find a more even allocation of power plants across the country than is the case when grid expansion costs are neglected.},

In {HE}, socio-technical thinking is fundamental as {HE} projects exist at the intersection of engineering and sustainable community development. However, the literature still lacks an understanding of the key features of socio-technical thinking. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this article is to investigate the key characteristics that distinguish the socio-technical thinking of an expert from a novice in the context of {HE} projects. Design/Method We distributed the Energy Conversion Playground ({ECP}) design task to students starting their engineering degree (n = 26) and practitioners (n = 16). We iteratively and inductively analyzed the responses to develop a rubric characterizing the key features of expert socio-technical thinking. We then scored participants' responses and compared them to identify differences between students and practitioners. Results The analysis showed that expert socio-technical thinkers can provide high-quality considerations across three domains: technology, people, and broader context. The comparison of the participants' scores showed that both students and practitioners scored highly in the technology domain. In contrast, students scored poorly in the people and broader contexts domains, identifying only simplistic considerations in these non-technical areas, if at all. Conclusions This study provides novel insights into the development of socio-technical thinking and further validates the {ECP} as a trustworthy measure of socio-technical thinking. Implications for engineering educators and multiple lines of future research are also discussed.},

	abstract = {International, national, and subnational laws and policies call for rapidly decarbonizing energy systems around the globe. This effort relies heavily on renewable electricity and calls for a transition that is: (i) flexible enough to accommodate existing and new electricity end uses and users; (ii) resilient in response to climate change and other threats to electricity infrastructure; (iii) cost-effective in comparison to alternatives; and (iv) just in the face of energy systems that are often the result of—or the cause of—procedural, distributive, and historical injustices. Acknowledging the intertwined roles of technology and policy, this work provides a cross-disciplinary review of how microgrids may contribute to renewable electricity systems that are flexible, resilient, cost-effective, and just (including illustrative examples from Korea, California, New York, the European Union, and elsewhere). Following this review of generalized microgrid characteristics, we more closely examine the role and potential of microgrids in two United States jurisdictions that have adopted 100\% renewable electricity standards (Hawai‘i and Puerto Rico), and which are actively developing regulatory regimes putatively designed to enable renewable microgrids. Collectively, this review shows that although microgrids have the potential to support the transition to 100\% renewable electricity in a variety of ways, the emerging policy structures require substantial further development to operationalize that potential. We conclude that unresolved fundamental policy tensions arise from justice considerations, such as how to distribute the benefits and burdens of microgrid infrastructure, rather than from technical questions about microgrid topologies and operating characteristics. Nonetheless, technical and quantitative future research will be necessary to assist regulators as they develop microgrid policies. In particular, there is a need to develop socio–techno–economic analyses of cost-effectiveness, which consider a broad range of potential benefits and costs.},

Regarding the ongoing energy transition in Germany, the extend usage of natural gas provide advantages that might be built a bridge to a low carbon energy system until 2050. Against this backdrop, this paper introduces a model for the German natural gas market ({GAMAMOD}-{DE}) with focus on infrastructure utilisation. Following a linear optimization approach, the model considers a highly resolved grid structure of pipelines, storages and cross-border connections to neighbouring countries. The spatial and temporal resolved gas demand is divided into three different sectors: industry, heating and electricity. An application for the year 2012 shows the performance and validation of the proposed model. Results show the utilisation of infrastructure and enable an assessment of the level of security of supply during the considered time frame. In addition, the findings suggest that although European customers suffered on cold winter days in 2012, from a system part of view, the security of supply ({SoS}) was always ensured. Further research should focus on analysing {SoS} and resilience of gas networks in the mid- and longterm, especially when sector coupling between electricity and gas is far advanced.},

In this paper, we suggest and evaluate an optimization procedure which specializes in solving a wide variety of optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is designed as a generic multi-objective, multi-optima optimizer. Care has been taken while designing the algorithm such that it automatically degenerates to efficient algorithms for solving other simpler optimization problems, such as single-objective uni-optimal problems, single-objective multi-optima problems and multi-objective uni-optimal problems. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in solving various problems is demonstrated on a number of test problems chosen from the literature. Because of its efficiency in handling different types of problems with equal ease, this algorithm should find increasing use in real-world optimization problems.},

In these problems, there are invariably unmodeled issues that can greatly impact the acceptability of solutions. Modeling to Generate Alternatives ({MGA}) is an approach for addressing unmodeled issues in an optimization context. {MGA} techniques are used to generate a small number of good, yet very different, solutions to optimization problems. Because these solutions are different in decision space, they may differ considerably in performance when unmodeled objectives are considered. Many problems are sufficiently complex that traditional optimization solution procedures, and therefore traditional {MGA} techniques, are not readily applicable. Two techniques for performing {MGA} using genetic algorithms ({GAs}) are investigated and compared. One of these techniques, which uses specialized {MGA} operators, is shown to produce solutions that are both better in quality and more different. This technique is also demonstrated for a realistic air quality management problem.},

Formal approaches to explore efficiently for good but maximally different alternative solutions have been established in the operations research literature, and have been shown to be valuable in identifying solutions that perform expectedly well with respect to modeled and unmodeled objectives. While the use of evolutionary algorithms ({EAs}) to solve real engineering optimization problems is becoming increasingly common, systematic alternatives-generation capabilities are not fully extended for {EAs}. This paper presents a new {EA}-based approach to generate alternatives ({EAGA}), and illustrates its applicability via two test problems. A realistic airline route network design problem was also solved and analyzed successfully using {EAGA}. The {EAGA} promises to be a flexible procedure for exploring alternative solutions that could assist when making decisions for real engineering optimization problems riddled with unmodeled or unquantified issues.},

	abstract = {In a multi-objective optimization problem, in addition to optimal solutions, multimodal and/or nearly optimal alternatives can also provide additional useful information for the decision maker. However, obtaining all nearly optimal solutions entails an excessive number of alternatives. Therefore, to consider the nearly optimal solutions, it is convenient to obtain a reduced set, putting the focus on the potentially useful alternatives. These solutions are the alternatives that are close to the optimal solutions in objective space, but which differ significantly in the decision space. To characterize this set, it is essential to simultaneously analyze the decision and objective spaces. One of the crucial points in an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm is the archiving strategy. This is in charge of keeping the solution set, called the archive, updated during the optimization process. The motivation of this work is to analyze the three existing archiving strategies proposed in the literature ({ArchiveUpdatePQ},ϵDxy, Archive\_nevMOGA, and {targetSelect}) that aim to characterize the potentially useful solutions. The archivers are evaluated on two benchmarks and in a real engineering example. The contribution clearly shows the main differences between the three archivers. This analysis is useful for the design of evolutionary algorithms that consider nearly optimal solutions.},

In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making.},

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one.

	abstract = {\textit{Wastelanding} tells the history of the uranium industry on Navajo land in the U.S. Southwest, asking why certain landscapes and the peoples who inhabit them come to be targeted for disproportionate exposure to environmental harm. Uranium mines and mills on the Navajo Nation land have long supplied U.S. nuclear weapons and energy programs. By 1942, mines on the reservation were the main source of uranium for the top-secret Manhattan Project. Today, the Navajo Nation is home to more than a thousand abandoned uranium sites. Radiation-related diseases are endemic, claiming the health and lives of former miners and nonminers alike.  Traci Brynne Voyles argues that the presence of uranium mining on Diné (Navajo) land constitutes a clear case of environmental racism. Looking at discursive constructions of landscapes, she explores how environmental racism develops over time. For Voyles, the "wasteland," where toxic materials are excavated, exploited, and dumped, is both a racial and a spatial signifier that renders an environment and the bodies that inhabit it pollutable. Because environmental inequality is inherent in the way industrialism operates, the wasteland is the "other" through which modern industrialism is established.  In examining the history of wastelanding in Navajo country, Voyles provides "an environmental justice history" of uranium mining, revealing how just as "civilization" has been defined on and through "savagery," environmental privilege is produced by portraying other landscapes as marginal, worthless, and pollutable.},

We find that (1) Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy and mitigation projects are as conflictive as {FF} projects, and that both disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities and Indigenous peoples. Amongst {LCE} projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10\% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.},

To show what is unique in ‘energy democracy’ beyond increased participation in energy policy, the prosumer is introduced as the ideal-typical citizen, highlighting the importance of the energy transition, the agency of material structures and a new emergent governmentality. ‘Energy democracy’ is conceptualized as an analytical and decision-making tool, defined along three dimensions: popular sovereignty, participatory governance and civic ownership, and operationalized with relevant indicators.},

Currently, primary siting authority for renewable energy projects rests with state and local governments, which generally exercise that authority through zoning and land use planning, while the federal government approves most interstate energy delivery systems. This fragmented system of governance can delay and even deter project development, simultaneously thwarting the optimal logic in developing a national renewable energy generation system. Proactive renewable energy project planning offers one potentially effective – and constitutional – solution to this renewable energy federalism dilemma, particularly in conjunction with negotiated siting guidelines and a centralized siting agency. Drawing upon the substantial body of scholarly work that advocates for federal or regional collaboration in renewable energy policymaking and for more balanced and dynamic federalism in the energy sector, this Article further advances those goals while also shifting the focal axis and underscoring renewable energy as the locus for expanding energy federalism and mitigating climate change.},

This study details how energy justice can serve as a novel conceptual tool for philosophers and ethicists that better integrates usually distinct distributive and procedural justice concerns. Energy justice serves as an important analytical tool for energy researchers striving to understand how values get built into energy systems or to resolve common energy problems. Energy justice presents a useful decision-making tool that can assist energy planners and consumers in making more informed energy choices. Our energy justice framework has elements of Kantian ethics, which takes each person as an end. It has libertarian elements of freedom and choice, suggesting that good societies present people with a set of opportunities or substantial freedoms, so they can choose to exercise these or not. It is pluralist about value, holding that capabilities for people are different and also that their own interests vary. It is concerned with justice as recognition, noting that failures of procedural justice can result in discrimination and marginalization. It, also, has elements focused on utilitarianism and welfare, attempting to improve the quality of life for all people, as defined by their capabilities.},

Yet oil presents a much larger problem for democracy: faced with the threats of oil depletion and catastrophic climate change, the democratic machineries that emerged to govern the age of carbon energy seem to be unable to address the processes that may end it. This article explores these multiple dimensions of carbon democracy, by examining the intersecting histories of coal, oil and democracy in the twentieth century. Following closely the methods by which fossil fuels were produced, distributed and converted into other forms of socio-technical organization, financial circulation and political power, the article traces ways in which the concentration and control of energy flows could open up democratic possibilities or close them down; how connections were engineered in the post-war period between the flow of oil and the flows of international finance, on which democratic stability was thought to depend; how these same circulations made possible the emergence of the economy and its unlimited growth as the main object of democratic politics; and how the relations among forms of energy, finance, economic knowledge, democracy and violence were transformed in the 1967–74 oil–dollar Middle East crises.},

	shorttitle = {The Price of Nuclear Power},
	abstract = {Rising fossil fuel prices and concerns about greenhouse gas emissions are fostering a nuclear power renaissance and a revitalized uranium mining industry across the American West. In \textit{The Price of Nuclear Power} , environmental sociologist Stephanie Malin offers an on-the-ground portrait of several uranium communities caught between the harmful legacy of previous mining booms and the potential promise of new economic development. Using this context, she examines how shifting notions of environmental justice inspire divergent views about nuclear power's sustainability and equally divisive forms of social activism.  Drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted in rural isolated towns such as Monticello, Utah, and Nucla and Naturita, Colorado, as well as in upscale communities like Telluride, Colorado, and incorporating interviews with community leaders, environmental activists, radiation regulators, and mining executives, Malin uncovers a fundamental paradox of the nuclear renaissance: the communities most hurt by uranium's legacy-such as high rates of cancers, respiratory ailments, and reproductive disorders-were actually quick to support industry renewal. She shows that many impoverished communities support mining not only because of the employment opportunities, but also out of a personal identification with uranium, a sense of patriotism, and new notions of environmentalism. But other communities, such as Telluride, have become sites of resistance, skeptical of industry and government promises of safe mining, fearing that regulatory enforcement won't be strong enough. Indeed, Malin shows that the nuclear renaissance has exacerbated social divisions across the Colorado Plateau, threatening social cohesion. Malin further illustrates ways in which renewed uranium production is not a socially sustainable form of energy development for rural communities, as it is utterly dependent on unstable global markets.   \textit{The Price of Nuclear Power} is an insightful portrait of the local impact of the nuclear renaissance and the social and environmental tensions inherent in the rebirth of uranium mining.},

	abstract = {We review over 60 “visioning documents” authored by non-profits and frontline community members in the United States. These visions of energy justice – authored by the actors and communities that have historically organized energy justice programming – are largely absent in the energy justice literature, but they provide guidance on research and policy gaps. This article provides a review and thematic coding of visions for a just energy future, which enables an understanding of how energy justice links to history, policy, and other social movements, and concretizes calls for “place-based”, “frontline-centered”, and “spatially situated” approaches to energy justice. We find that organizations draft visioning documents because of the inherent value of community visioning to build shared political will, to assert their priorities in a policy space that has historically disregarded equity and justice, and to move climate policy in a transformative direction. That so many visioning documents exist suggests the insufficiency of current policy approaches, which are described in visioning documents as deficient in addressing the root causes and economic structures driving climate change. Additionally, we identify 6 principles of a just energy future articulated in these documents: (1) being place-based, (2) addressing the root causes and legacies of inequality, (3) shifting the balance of power in existing forms of energy governance, (4) creating new, cooperative, and participatory systems of energy governance and ownership, (5) adopting a rights-based approach, and (6) rejecting false solutions. We discuss how these principles can advance the energy justice literature and be applied across areas of energy policy intervention and geographies.},

While some individuals, households and communities are reaping the benefits of the move toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy, others are experiencing its adverse effects, such as disruptions to labor markets, higher energy prices, and pollution and health burdens. To address these disparities, policymakers are increasingly calling for energy justice. However, there is scant scholarly literature on either the prevalence or characteristics of energy justice programs that already exist. Here we show that energy justice programs are both quite widespread and diverse across the United States, are most often led by nonprofit organizations rather than government agencies, and, while many share common missions, programs entail unique and often innovative strategies to achieve their objectives. The analysis lends important insights into current energy justice programs, but we argue deeper evaluation is necessary to identify which efforts are efficacious.},

We construct the dimensions of the framework, provide an illustration using the case of the renewable portfolio standard, generate a vulnerability score measure and map vulnerability across {US} counties.

	abstract = {Environmental justice is a major movement and organizing discourse in the environmental politics arena, and both the movement and the idea have had a large influence on the way that climate justice has been conceptualized. While most discussions of climate justice in the academic literature focus on ideal conceptions and normative arguments of justice theory, or on the pragmatic policy of the more elite environmental nongovernmental organizations ({NGOs}), a distinct discourse has developed out of the grassroots. In these movement articulations of climate justice, the concerns and principles of environmental justice are clear and consistent. Here, climate justice focuses on local impacts and experience, inequitable vulnerabilities, the importance of community voice, and demands for community sovereignty and functioning. This review traces the discourse of environmental justice from its development, through the range of principles and demands of grassroots climate justice movements, to more recent articulations of ideas for just adaptation to climate change.

Our framing of environmental justice scholarship centers on the necessity of examining the role of state and institutional violence in producing environmental injustice through interlocking systems of racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and enslavement. We link themes of violence and the role of the state in the expansion of environmental justice studies to the major topics of land and resource conflicts, prisons and incarceration, and emotions. We draw on this scholarship to explore how theories and politics of environmental justice are inflected by the constraints and leverage points within racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and the afterlives of enslavement.

	abstract = {Although a large body of quantitative environmental justice research exists, only a handful of studies have examined the processes by which racial and socioeconomic disparities in the location of polluting industrial facilities can occur. These studies have had mixed results, we contend, principally because of methodological differences, that is, the use of the unit-hazard coincidence method as compared to distance-based methods. This study is the first national-level environmental justice study to conduct longitudinal analyses using distance-based methods. Our purposes are to: (1) determine whether disparate siting, post-siting demographic change, or a combination of the two created present-day disparities; (2) test related explanations; and (3) determine whether the application of distance-based methods helps resolve the inconsistent findings of previous research. We used a national database of commercial hazardous waste facilities sited from 1966 to 1995 and examined the demographic composition of host neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes that occurred after siting. We found strong evidence of disparate siting for facilities sited in all time periods. Although we found some evidence of post-siting demographic changes, they were mostly a continuation of changes that occurred in the decade or two prior to siting, suggesting that neighborhood transition serves to attract noxious facilities rather than the facilities themselves attracting people of color and low income populations. Our findings help resolve inconsistencies among the longitudinal studies and builds on the evidence from other subnational studies that used distance-based methods. We conclude that racial discrimination and sociopolitical explanations (i.e., the proposition that siting decisions follow the ‘path of least resistance’) best explain present-day inequities.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognition that institutions matter for international development, the debates over institutional reforms tend to obscure the role of power. Neoliberal models of development are often promoted in terms of their technical merits and efficiency gains and rarely account for the multiple ways that social, economic and political power shape institutional design and institutional change. Even recent efforts to address power tend to conceptualize it too narrowly. This special issue seeks to rethink the role of power in institutional creation and change in the context of persistent neoliberalism. In the introduction, we synthesize the literature on the nature of power to develop a new conceptual framework – a power in institutions matrix – that highlights the multiple dimensions of power involved in institutional development and change. We argue that such a theoretically-informed mapping of power in institutions will enable scholars, practitioners, and citizen groups to go beyond the standard critiques in order to analyze the multifaceted effects of neoliberal institutional change. Our introduction draws on an extensive literature review as well as the special issue contributors who examine institutional change in a variety of policy sectors in Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North America. We find that a range of diverse local, national and transnational actors, with disparate access to power, negotiate institutional changes from above and below through overt imposition of and resistance to new rules, influence of agendas, and promotion of discourses. Neoliberalism thus creates a new distributive politics. The special issue thus offers a theoretically-grounded approach for linking international and domestic power differences to the process of institutional change, with a specific focus on equity and sustainability. In a departure from the current literature’s focus on elite bargains, we showcase the efforts by less powerful groups to gain a foothold in decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {In this article we introduce a Special Issue of Energy Research and Social Science focused on energy infrastructure and the political economy of national development. Many countries are experiencing transformational growth in energy infrastructure, such as transmission and distribution systems; import, export and storage facilities; the development of domestic energy resources; and construction of new power generating stations based on wind, water, coal, gas and nuclear sources. Large-scale projects like these are frequently justified by appeals to grand narratives – promoting economic growth, securing energy supply, modernizing energy service provision, and transitioning to more environmentally sustainable energy systems - in which the fate of the nation is closely tied to infrastructural development. The papers in this collection present compelling empirical evidence of how claims for energy infrastructure’s national significance and/or necessity intersect with the (re)production of political and economic power. Drawing on case material from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe, they highlight the capacity of different energy technologies and infrastructural assemblages to shape political and economic outcomes beyond their role in storing, transporting or transforming energy. This Introduction to the Special Issue does three things. First, it characterises the scale and significance of the contemporary ‘infrastructural moment’, observing how, in many national contexts, energy policy-making remains centralised and divorced from public participation. Second, it critically differentiates existing literature on the political economy of energy infrastructure to identify five distinctive ways in which research understands the ‘political work’ infrastructure performs. Third, it introduces the papers in the Special Issue and organises them into four key themes. Overall, the Introduction affirms the importance for social science of understanding the economically and politically constitutive power of energy infrastructures. The critical reflexivity this requires is essential to moving towards energy infrastructures that are just, equitable and sustainable.},

I conceptualise the new eco-political dysfunctionality of democracy as one dimension of a more encompassing legitimation crisis of democracy which, in turn, has triggered a profound transformation of democracy. Ultimately, exactly this transformation constitutes the glass ceiling to the socio-ecological restructuring of capitalist consumer societies. It changes democracy into a tool for the politics of unsustainability, in which the legitimation-dependent state is a key actor.},

	abstract = {In future electricity systems, not only electricity generation but also frequency stabilization must be provided by low-carbon technologies. Battery systems are a promising solution to fill this gap. However, uncertainties regarding their revenue potential may hinder investments. Therefore, we apply the agent-based electricity market model {AMIRIS} to simulate a day-ahead market and an automatic frequency restoration reserves market. Demonstrating the model setup, we chose a scenario with high shares of renewable energies. First, we back-test our model with historic market data from Germany in 2019. The simulation results’ mean day-ahead prices of 39.20EUR/{MWh} are close to the historic ones of 38.70EUR/{MWh}. Second, we model both markets in a scenario for 2030. The simulated day-ahead market prices are higher on average than observed today, although, we find around 550 h/yr in which the load is fully covered by renewable energies. The variance in simulated prices is slightly higher compared to historic values. Bids on the reserve capacity market are derived from opportunity costs of not participating in the day-ahead market. This results in prices of up to 45EUR/{MW} for positive reserve while the prices for negative reserve are 0EUR/{MW}. Finally, we evaluate revenue potentials of battery storages. Compared to 2019, we see an improved economic potential and increased importance of the day-ahead market. High power battery storages perform best whereas improvements in round-trip efficiency only marginally improve revenues. Although demonstrated for Germany, the presented modular approach can be adapted to international markets enabling comprehensive battery storage assessments.},

Integrating these new energy resources and technologies will lead to profound structural changes in energy systems, such as an increasing need for storage and a radical electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. To capture the increasing complexity of such future energy systems, new flexible and open-source optimization modelling tools are needed. This paper presents {EnergyScope} {TD}, a novel open-source model for the strategic energy planning of urban and regional energy systems. Compared to other existing energy models, which are often proprietary, computationally expensive and mostly focused on the electricity sector, {EnergyScope} {TD} optimises both the investment and operating strategy of an entire energy system (including electricity, heating and mobility). Additionally, its hourly resolution (using typical days) makes the model suitable for the integration of intermittent renewables, and its concise mathematical formulation and computational efficiency are appropriate for uncertainty applications. We present the linear programming model, detailing its formulation, and we apply it to a real-world case study to discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modelling frameworks. In particular, we model the national energy system of Switzerland to evaluate a 50\% renewable energy scenario.},

We here compare {CSP} (concentrating solar power) and nuclear power as baseload electricity providers for the case of South Africa, which is adding significant new generation capacity, has an abundant solar resource, but also one existing and additional planned nuclear power plants. Both of these technologies are considered baseload-capable with sufficient available fuel (sunlight or fissible material) to provide large amounts of nearly emissions-free electricity. We find that under a range of technological learning assumptions, {CSP} compares favorably against nuclear on costs in the period to 2030, and has lower investment and environmental risks. The results suggest that while nuclear power may be an important low-emissions power technology in regions with little sun, in the case of South Africa, {CSP} could be capable of providing a stable baseload supply at lower cost than nuclear power, and may have other non-cost benefits.},

	abstract = {Mitigating climate change is driving the need to decarbonize the electricity sector, for which various possible technological options exist, alongside uncertainty over which options are preferable in terms of cost, emissions reductions, and energy security. To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50\%, depending on storage capacity costs. The {UK} can rely on its domestic wind and solar {PV} generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10\% above the mean of 0.084 {GBP}/{kWh} for shares of 50\% and below at a 70\% share, which is 35\% higher. However, for more than an 80\% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available.},

We study the effects of {CO}2 price floors and a price ceiling on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely based on Great Britain, which already has introduced a price floor, and on Central Western Europe). Using an agent-based electricity market simulation with endogenous investment and a {CO}2 market (including banking), we analyse the cross-border effects of national policies as well as system-wide policy options. A common, moderate {CO}2 auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway. This reduces {CO}2 price volatility and the occurrence of carbon shortage price periods, as well as the average cost to consumers. A price ceiling can shield consumers from extreme price shocks. These price restrictions do not cause a large risk of an overall emissions overshoot in the long run. A national price floor lowers the cost to consumers in the other zone; the larger the zone with the price floor, the stronger the effect. Price floors that are too high lead to inefficiencies in investment choices and to higher consumer costs.},

The rapid expansion of {RES} requires a structural rearrangement of the entire power system to ensure the current level of supply security. Scientific approaches to the characterization and improvement of power transmission networks, however, often lack the availability of reliable and appropriate data on the networks’ structure. Using {SciGRID}, which was recently released open source, we generate a topological grid model for Germany using open data provided by {OpenStreetMap}. Starting from this particular grid model we characterize the structure of the German transmission grid by means of graph-theoretical decomposition approaches to complexity reduction. Our procedure aims to identify key features and characteristics complementing the grid’s electrotechnical properties; it is for example used to characterize the {SciGRID} approach and validate the resulting models against other (potentially not open source) transmission network models. In addition, it paves the way for networks with reduced complexity, which might be beneficial in optimization problems addressing system design and operation.},

This paper describes the open-source {MEDEAS} modeling framework, which has been developed with the aim of informing decision-making to achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems with a focus on biophysical, economic, social and technological restrictions and tackling some of the limitations identified in the current {IAMs}. {MEDEAS} models include the following relevant characteristics: representation of biophysical constraints to energy availability; modeling of the mineral and energy investments for the energy transition, allowing a dynamic assessment of the potential mineral scarcities and computation of the net energy available to society; consistent representation of climate change damages with climate assessments by natural scientists; integration of detailed sectoral economic structure (input–output analysis) within a system dynamics approach; energy shifts driven by physical scarcity; and a rich set of socioeconomic and environmental impact indicators. The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the {MEDEAS}-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.},

The mixed-integer linear program minimises total system cost while complying with operational constraints, carbon emission targets, and ancillary service requirements. A data clustering technique and the relaxation of integer scheduling constraints is evaluated and applied to decrease the model solution time. Two cost learning curves for the different power technologies are derived: one assuming local learning effects, the other accounting for global knowledge spill-over. A piece-wise linear formulation allows the integration of the exponential learning curves into the {ESO}-{XEL} model. The model is applied to the {UK} power system in the time frame of 2015 to 2050. The consideration of cost learning effects moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies. In addition, the maximum capacity build rate parameter influences the share of power generation significantly; the possibility of rapid capacity build-up is more important for total system cost reduction by 2050 than accounting for technology cost reduction.},

We compare key characteristics of the different models, provide an overview of model applications, and summarize key findings on power storage requirements. We also evaluate which system values of storage are covered by respective model analyses. Based on the literature survey, we identify common findings and key model features required for a sound assessment of future storage requirements. In order to raise complementary insights, we introduce {DIETER}, a new dispatch and investment model. The model contributes to the literature by capturing multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, capacity, and reserve provision.

	abstract = {The software for techno-economic simulation of stationary energy storage systems ({SimSES}) enables a detailed technoeconomic simulation and evaluation of stationary energy storage systems with the current main focus on lithium-ion batteries. Various applications of battery energy storage systems can be simulated, for example, the increase of selfconsumption in households with {PV} and storage systems or the provision of primary control reserve. The main component of the modular and flexible software-tool is an abstract approach to the energy storage model, which allows the variation of different storage technologies and technical sub-components. Furthermore, stress characterization enables the estimation of the energy storage device's degradation. Various aging models can be used for this purpose, whereby detailed models based on aging experiments especially for batteries are currently developed at the {EES} Institute. In order to optimize the utilization of the energy storage in the different applications, a large number of operating strategies are implemented. Time series simulations allow for technical evaluations and calculation of relevant key figures. Furthermore, economic key performance indicators are derived and enable the assessment and comparison of the simulation results. It is planned to make {SimSES} available for public usage and further development as open-source software.},

It provides power flow, optimal power flow, state estimation, topological graph searches and short circuit calculations according to {IEC} 60909. pandapower includes a Newton-Raphson power flow solver formerly based on {PYPOWER}, which has been accelerated with just-in-time compilation. Additional enhancements to the solver include the capability to model constant current loads, grids with multiple reference nodes and a connectivity check. The pandapower network model is based on electric elements, such as lines, two and three-winding transformers or ideal switches. All elements can be defined with nameplate parameters and are internally processed with equivalent circuit models, which have been validated against industry standard software tools. The tabular data structure used to define networks is based on the Python library pandas, which allows comfortable handling of input and output parameters. The implementation in Python makes pandapower easy to use and allows comfortable extension with third-party libraries. pandapower has been successfully applied in several grid studies as well as for educational purposes. A comprehensive, publicly available case-study demonstrates a possible application of pandapower in an automated time series calculation.},

The model simulates the electricity market operation for the entire region at half hourly resolution and produces results in terms of electricity prices, cross border flows, emissions and associated total system costs. The impact of two carbon prices is examined within the model. Results highlight the policy challenges that arise when individual Member States formulate renewable energy plans in isolation in the absence of integrated modelling of interconnected regions as cross border power flows play a more significant role in market dynamics especially in the presence of geographically dispersed variable renewable generation sources such as wind and solar. From a policy perspective results suggest that based on these national plans, congestion will be present on a number of key lines at long periods during the year.},

In addition, it covers timescales from seconds to days. Contrary to other approaches following an agent or co-simulation concept, {MOCES} is monolithic, based on the modeling language Modelica. To meet the requirements imposed on a simulation tool, we use the possibility to enhance Modelica within its language specification. The basic idea of {MOCES} is to extend the physical model of each entity by a connected representative in a parallel simulation. To show the feasibility of the concept, a simulation example investigates the benefits and drawbacks of local energy markets.},

	abstract = {The advancing energy transition is leading to a constantly increasing number of prosumers and active participants in the energy system. Local energy markets are considered a promising approach to coordinate those active participants efficiently, increase acceptance among the population, and decrease grid expansion costs. However, energy models and markets do not consider heterogeneous user preferences which are considered crucial for the progressing energy transition. Therefore, this paper proposes new auction-based local energy market models that consider user preferences and users’ willingness to pay a premium for heterogeneous energy qualities. In order to account for the unknown and stochastic user behavior in such a new market setting, we simulate and compare existing and newly developed auction-based clearing algorithms with an unbiased Monte Carlo method and evaluate whether they fulfill pre-defined key characteristics. Based on the results, we conclude and identify a clearing algorithm that verifiably satisfies user preferences, considers willingness to pay a premium, increases local coverage of electricity, maintains individual rationality, and computational tractability. The presented clearing algorithms enable new market designs that can help to increase acceptance and accelerate the expansion of renewable energies. All market models and simulations are publicly available in the open-source repository lemlab. Future research will validate the presented results in a field trial in Germany with 20 households.},

Applying this methodology to Great Britain for 2050, we find that {VRE}-focused power system design is highly sensitive to the inter-annual variability of weather and that planning based on a single year can lead to operational inadequacy and failure to meet long-term decarbonization objectives. However, some insights do emerge that are relatively stable to weather-year. Reinforcement of the transmission system consistently leads to a decrease in system costs while electricity storage and flexible generation, needed to integrate {VRE} into the system, are generally deployed close to demand centres.},

	abstract = {Averting the impending harms of climate change requires to replace fossil fuels with renewables as a primary source of energy. Non-electric renewable potential being limited, this implies extending the use of electricity generated from wind and solar beyond the power sector, either by direct electrification or synthetic fuels. Modeling the transformation towards such an energy system is challenging, because it imposes to consider fluctuations of wind and solar and the manifold ways the demand side could adjust to these fluctuations. This paper introduces a graph-based method to formulate energy system models to address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two features to facilitate modeling high shares of renewables and sector integration are enabled. First, the method allows the level of temporal and spatial detail to be varied by energy carrier. This enables modeling with a high level of detail and a large scope, while keeping models computationally tractable. Second, the degree to which energy carriers are substitutable when converted, stored, transported, or consumed can be modeled to achieve a detailed but flexible representation of sector integration. An application of the formulation demonstrates that the variation of temporal detail achieves an average reduction in computation time of 70{\textbackslash}\%.},

However, assessments and policy advice regarding ancillary services and market design lack methods to evaluate the complex interaction of markets and services. Therefore, this paper contributes an open-source agent-based model to test design options for ancillary services and electricity markets. The Ancillary Services Acquisition Model ({ASAM}) combines the agent-based modeling framework {MESA} with the toolbox Python for Power System Analysis ({PyPSA}). The model provides various design parameters per market and agent-specific strategies as well as detailed clearing algorithms for the day-ahead market, intra-day continuous trading, redispatch, and imbalances. Moreover, {ASAM} includes numerous policy performance indicators, including a novel price mark-up indicator and novel redispatch performance indicators. A stylized simulation scenario verified and validated the model and addressed a redispatch design question. The results displayed the following implications from order types in redispatch markets with multi-period all-or-none design: (1) The order design provides few risks for market parties, as orders are fully cleared. (2) Large orders may lead to dispatch ramps before and after the delivery period and may cause “ramp-risk” mark-ups as well as additional trading of imbalances on intra-day. (3) All-or-none design in a liquid situation leads to the over-procurement of redispatch by the grid operator, as orders cannot be partially activated. Moreover, it is likely that the grid operator induces imbalances to the system by “incomplete” redispatch activation (i.e. upward and downward redispatch volumes are not equal).},

The model structure, its components, and linkages are presented in detail; an additional case study demonstrates the capability of our sociotechnical model. We find that changes in the political framework cannot be mapped directly to {RES} operators as behaviour of intermediary market actors has to be considered as well. Characteristics and strategies of intermediaries are thus an important factor for successful {RES} marketing and further deployment.

	abstract = {This article introduces and describes {OPERA}, a new technology-rich bottom-up energy system optimization model for the Netherlands. We give a detailed specification of {OPERA}’s underlying methodology and approach, as well as a description of its multiple applications. The model has been used extensively to formulate strategic policy advice on energy decarbonization and climate change mitigation for the Dutch government, and to perform exploratory studies on the role of specific low-carbon energy technologies in the energy transition of the Netherlands. Based on a reference scenario established through extensive consultation with industry and the public sector, {OPERA} allows for examining the impact of autonomous technology diffusion and energy efficiency improvement processes, and investigating a broad range of policy interventions that target greenhouse gas emission abatement or air pollution reduction, amongst others. Two characteristics that render {OPERA} particularly useful are the fact that (1) it covers the entire energy system and all greenhouse gas emissions of the Netherlands, and (2) it possesses a high temporal resolution, including a module for flexibly handling individual time units. The simulation of the complete Dutch energy system and the ability to represent energy supply and demand on an hourly basis allow for making balanced judgments on how to best accommodate large amounts of variable renewable energy production. {OPERA} is therefore particularly suited for analyzing subjects in the field of system integration, which makes it an ideal tool for assessing the implementation of the energy transition and the establishment of a low-carbon economy. We outline several near-term developments and opportunities for future improvements and refinements of {OPERA}. One of {OPERA}’s attractive features is that its structure can readily be applied to other countries, notably in Europe, and could thus relatively easily be extended to cover the entire European Union.},

	abstract = {An efficient, reliable and cost-effective energy storage is necessary to increase the use of renewables and to contribute in reducing the carbon footprint of the electricity grid. A novel iron-air battery characterized by high performance, safety and reliability for operation at intermediate temperatures (500–650 °C) is demonstrated. The iron-air rechargeable battery is based on a new configuration where both the nickel-electrode and the hydrogen/water redox processes, generally utilized in high temperature ceramic batteries, are avoided in this system completely operating in the solid state. This can increase the durability and reliability of the battery while providing excellent performance (specific energy of 0.46 Wh g−1, specific capacity of 0.5 Ah g−1, faradaic efficiency 80\%). These characteristics favourably compare to low temperature iron-air batteries. Excellent performance and cyclability are achieved at 650 °C for the iron-air solid-state battery showing no relevant degradation after more than 100 cycles. The concept is based on a composite iron-ceria anode in contact with an oxygen anion-conducting lanthanum gallate electrolyte and a mixed conductivity lanthanum ferrite perovskite-based cathode. This combines both simplicity of operation and intrinsic safety with high energy density and durability. The excellent dynamic behaviour, the absence of influence of external environmental conditions and the use of cost-effective ceramic materials, with the possibility to produce high quality heat to cover the chain of electrical and thermal energy, make such systems largely appealing for applications related to renewable power sources.},

Experts are conceived of as unreflexive, but lay public actors as reflexive. To provide a concrete grounding for this claim, this paper offers a conceptual analysis of Brian Wynne's work on the public understanding of science. Wynne's work intersects theorizing about late modernity (explored via a comparison with Beck's and Giddens') and debates about the role of experts and the public in decision-making (explored via a comparison to Collins and Evans). I show that Wynne's work, as with Beck's and Giddens', and Collins and Evans', embodies different conceptions of lay actors. In Wynne's work ambivalence arises concerning whether social identities or social relationships ground the theoretical account. I suggest the tension arises because of the general desire of the social science analyst to preserve the autonomy of the lay actor.},

The analysis identifies several substantive factors which influence the credibility of scientific communication. Starting from the now-accepted point that public uptake of science depends primarily upon the trust and credibility public groups are prepared to invest in scientific institutions and representatives, the paper observes that these are contingent upon the social relationships and identities which people feel to be affected by scientific knowledge, which never comes free of social interests or implications. The case study shows laypeople capable of extensive informal reflection upon their social relationships towards scientific experts, and on the epistemological status of their own `local' knowledge in relation to `outside' knowledge. Public uptake of science might be improved if scientific institutions expressed an equivalent reflexive discourse in the public domain.},

For a long time, people have argued that social science issues should be given more prominence in engineering curricula. More to the point, social studies of technology have repeatedly observed how important the understanding of the social world is to successful engineering.

The science of loss and damage has evolved with the development of extreme event attribution science, which assesses the probability of an extreme event being influenced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, but loss and damage still suffers from the lack of a clear definition and measurability and is further complicated by debates on climate justice and shared but differentiated responsibilities.

We provide such analysis for 176 countries and found a strong (rs = -0.798;95\%{CI} -0.852, -0.727) and significant (p{\textless}0.0001) relationship between the distribution of climate risk and toxic pollution. We also found that inequities in pollution production, economic status, and institutional readiness are interconnected and exacerbate risk for countries already in the highest risk categories for both toxic and non-toxic (greenhouse gas) pollution. The findings have policy implications, including the use of the proposed Target assessment to decide where best to address toxic and non-toxic pollution simultaneously, based on the need to minimize human suffering and maximize return on effort.},

However, energy prices display a bilateral relationship with geopolitical risks in any economy. Any hike in the price of energy stimulates geopolitical risk factors and visa-versa. The consequences adversely impact economies and bring forth international tensions. This paper bridges a gap between the influence of geopolitical risks relating to energy and international tensions by analyzing micro-level operational measures. We deploy an empirical model to predict the energy sector and possible risk factors incorporating Eurostat data on twenty-seven states, from 2011 to 2020. This study collected a different energy variable to support the multiple regression model constructed by the “blocks” (hierarchical linear regression) method. The results suggest that geopolitical risks cause adverse effects on both the energy and other corporate sectors. The future direction of this research is to estimate how statistical model relationships may assist the corporate sector, and investors, in adopting mitigating measures to control upcoming geopolitical risks due to energy risks caused by geopolitical unrest.},

Recognition justice has a distinct status compared to the other two as its meaning seems the least tangible to grasp. In this article, a systematic literature study was conducted to the definitions and interpretations of recognition justice, showing that the concept currently refers to a large variety of phenomena. This diversity obscures what “recognition justice” actually measures. This paper aims to revisit the concept of recognition justice in energy justice by asking the following question: what does the tenet of recognition justice refer to, taking into account the philosophical roots of the concept? To do so, key texts from Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser were studied in-depth, resulting in four main insights: (1) there are two approaches to recognition justice; (2) actors can be (mis)recognised in multiple ways; (3) two different yet complementary methods for identifying instances of misrecognition can be distinguished; and (4) recognition justice cannot be reduced to other tenets of justice. These findings cumulate in a revisited definition of recognition justice as concerned with the adequate recognition of all actors through love, law, and status order. This definition structures the large variety of understandings in the scholarship, and it has the potential to provide a more fine-grained explanation of energy controversies, which advances the ultimate aim of making energy systems and policies more just.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modelling has the potential to provide insight into complex energy transition dynamics. Despite a recent emphasis of research on agent-based modelling and on energy transitions, an overview of how the methodology may be of value to understanding transition processes is still missing from the literature. This systematic review evaluates the potential of agent-based modelling to understanding energy transitions from a social-scientific perspective, based on a set of 62 articles. Six topic areas were identified, addressing different components of the energy system: Electricity Market, Consumption Dynamics/ Consumer Behaviour, Policy and Planning, New Technologies/ Innovation, Energy System, Transitions. Distribution of articles across topic areas was indicative of a continuing interest in electricity market related enquiries, and an increasing number of studies in the realm of policy and planning. Based on the relevance of energy transition specific complexities to the choice of {ABM} as a methodology, four complexity categories (1–4) were identified. Indicating the degree of association between the complexity of energy transitions and {ABM}’s ability to address these, the categorisation revealed that 35 of the 62 studies directly linked the choice of {ABM} to energy transition complexities (complexity category 1) or were set in the context of energy transitions (complexity category 2). The review further showed that the greatest potential contribution of {ABM} to energy transition studies lies in its practical application to decision-making in policy and planning. More interdisciplinary collaboration in model development is recommended to address the discrepancy between the relevance of social factors to modelling energy transitions and the ability of the social sciences to make effective use of {ABM}.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review is to discuss how quantitative modelling of energy scenarios for sustainable energy transition pathways can be made more realistic by taking into account insights from the socio-technical and related literatures. The proposition is that an enriched modelling approach would focus not just on technology development and deployment, but also on feedback loops, learning processes, policy and governance, behavioural changes, the interlinkages between the energy sector and other economic sectors, and infrastructure development. The review discusses a range of socio-technical concepts with a view to how they can enrich the understanding and modelling of highly complex dynamic systems such as flexible energy systems with high shares of variable renewable energy. In this context, application of system dynamics modelling ({SDM}) for the analysis of energy transitions is also introduced by describing the differences between {SDM} and a traditional modelling approach that uses econometric and linear programming methods. A conceptual framework for this type of modelling is provided by using causal loop diagrams. The diagrams illustrate the endogenous approach of {SDM} – understanding and modelling the structure of a system, which is responsible for its dynamic behaviour. {SDM} can also capture the co-evolution of economic, policy, technology, and behavioural factors over sufficiently long time periods, which is necessary for the analysis of transition pathway dynamics. In this regard, the review summarises how socio-technical concepts can be approached in {SDM} and why they are relevant for the analysis of flexibility in energy systems. From a computational point of view, it could be beneficial to combine {SDM} with technologically detailed energy system optimization models and that could be a way forward for achieving more realistic, non-linear quantitative modelling of sustainable energy transitions.},

	abstract = {Economic development, technological innovation, and policy change are especially prominent factors shaping energy transitions. Therefore explaining energy transitions requires combining insights from disciplines investigating these factors. The existing literature is not consistent in identifying these disciplines nor proposing how they can be combined. We conceptualize national energy transitions as a co-evolution of three types of systems: energy flows and markets, energy technologies, and energy-related policies. The focus on the three types of systems gives rise to three perspectives on national energy transitions: techno-economic with its roots in energy systems analysis and various domains of economics; socio-technical with its roots in sociology of technology, {STS}, and evolutionary economics; and political with its roots in political science. We use the three perspectives as an organizing principle to propose a meta-theoretical framework for analyzing national energy transitions. Following Elinor Ostrom's approach, the proposed framework explains national energy transitions through a nested conceptual map of variables and theories. In comparison with the existing meta-theoretical literature, the three perspectives framework elevates the role of political science since policies are likely to be increasingly prominent in shaping 21st century energy transitions.},

	abstract = {The varied effects of recent extreme weather events around the world exemplify the uneven impacts of climate change on populations, even within relatively small geographic regions. Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Because the impacts are most acutely felt in local communities, it is critical to improve understanding of the response options that are available for and being chosen by communities. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of case studies reporting community-based responses to climate change hazards. Based on content analysis of published case studies, we generated an emergent evidence-based typology of such responses according to their nature and goals. Using this typology, we quantitatively analysed more than 1500 response examples and determined the patterns with which community-level climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation strategies vary across world regions and across economic and governance conditions. Specifically, diversity of responses is lower in developing countries, and implementation of local-level policy and planning responses is less frequent in countries characterised by low governance quality. Our results confirm that, although there is much that local communities can do to respond to the challenges of climate change, there is also a need for increased support of local activities. By synthesising data from many local studies, our research provides a first global evidence base for local-level climate change adaptation policy.},

The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk.},

	abstract = {The notion of disproportionate impacts of climate change on certain groups and regions has long been a part of policy debates and scientific inquiry, and was instrumental to the emergence of the “Loss and Damage” (L\&D) policy agenda in international negotiations on climate change. Yet, ‘disproportionality’ remains relatively undefined and implicit in science on loss and damage from climate change. A coherent theoretical basis of disproportionality is needed for advancing science and policy on loss and damage. It is necessary to ask: What is disproportionate, to whom, and in relation to what? We critically examine the uses of disproportionality in loss and damage scholarship by analyzing how disproportionality is treated in the literature conceptually, methodologically, and empirically. We review publications against a set of criteria derived from seminal work on disproportionality in other fields, mainly environmental justice and disaster studies that have analyzed environment–society interactions. We find disproportionality to be dynamic and multidimensional, spanning the themes of risks, impacts, and burdens. Our results show that while the concept is often used in loss and damage scholarship, its use relies on unarticulated notions of justice and often lacks conceptual, methodological and empirical grounding. Disproportionality also appears as a boundary concept, enabling critical and multiscalar explorations of historical processes that shape the uneven impacts of climate change, alongside social justice and normative claims for desired futures. This emerging area of science offers an opportunity to critically re-evaluate the conceptualization of the relationship between climate-change-related impacts, development, and inequality.

	abstract = {The concept of risk is a key aspect of how the {IPCC} assesses and communicates to decision-makers the
potential adverse impacts of, and response options to, climate change.
The use of the concept of risk has not been fully consistent across Working Groups or between
assessment cycles, given that the concept itself and its use by {IPCC} has continued to evolve. Since the
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5{ºC}, cross-Working Group efforts have been put in place to
develop a consistent risk framing throughout the subsequent products of {IPCCs} Sixth Assessment Cycle
({AR}6).
The purpose of this guidance note is to promote a more consistent and transparent application of the
concept of risk across Working Groups in the sixth assessment cycle and to provide the foundation for
its use and possible further evolution in future assessment cycles.
This guidance note seeks to maximise consistency among Working Groups while recognising
differences in how the concept of risk is used across scientific disciplines and relevant literature.
Consistent use of the concept of risk is intended to provide a more robust, clear and transparent basis
for communicating climate change-related risks and risk management options to decision-makers
working in a wide range of institutional and policy settings.
The scope of this guidance is relatively narrow. This document merely seeks to clarify how the term
‘risk’ should be used where and when authors consider it appropriate to use this concept within their
assessment – it does not propose an overarching risk-centred framework for assessment of climate
change impacts and responses in {IPCC} reports in order not to preclude consideration of beneficial
consequences from impacts or responses.},

The heat index, which measures how the temperature actually feels on the body, would hit 126 degrees by the time the day was over. Meteorologists had been warning residents about a two-day heat wave, but these temperatures did not end that soon. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; the records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. And by July 20, over seven hundred people had perished-more than twice the number that died in the Chicago Fire of 1871, twenty times the number of those struck by Hurricane Andrew in 1992—in the great Chicago heat wave, one of the deadliest in American history.

Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a "social autopsy," examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been},

The paper identifies three main channels through which the inequality-aggravating effect of climate change materializes, namely (a) increase in the exposure of the disadvantaged groups to the adverse effects of climate change; (b) increase in their susceptibility to damage caused by climate change; and (c) decrease in their ability to cope and recover from the damage suffered. The paper presents evidence to illustrate each of the processes above. It also notes that the same analytical framework can be used to discuss the relationship between climate change and inequality across countries.

In response, state and local governments have developed solar equity programs, primarily focused on increasing adoption by low- and moderate-income ({LMI}) households. This study merged national datasets that estimate rooftop solar potential, the distribution of rooftop solar systems, and census tract- level socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to answer three questions. First, how are spatial distributions of rooftop potential and penetration similar and different across cities? Second, how is rooftop penetration distributed across non-{LMI} and {LMI} communities in different cities? Third, how do the relationships between rooftop penetration and local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, identified as barriers to solar adoption, differ? Using {GIS}, bivariate and multivariate analyses, these questions were examined in four {US} cities – Riverside and San Bernardino, California, Washington, {DC}, and Chicago, Illinois – to understand both universal and distinct local manifestations. Findings include: higher rooftop potential existed in some {LMI} communities; higher rooftop potential did not necessarily translate to higher rooftop penetration, especially if higher potential was in {LMI} communities; and beyond income, other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, limited English proficiency, age of housing stock, and internet access were associated with rooftop penetration. While there remains great potential for expanding rooftop solar to {LMI} households and communities, understanding the local dynamics of solar potential and penetration may inform better policy development and implementation.},

	abstract = {Many countries have implemented national climate policies to accomplish pledged Nationally Determined Contributions and to contribute to the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2023, the global stocktake will assess the combined effort of countries. Here, based on a public policy database and a multi-model scenario analysis, we show that implementation of current policies leaves a median emission gap of 22.4 to 28.2 {GtCO}2eq by 2030 with the optimal pathways to implement the well below 2 °C and 1.5 °C Paris goals. If Nationally Determined Contributions would be fully implemented, this gap would be reduced by a third. Interestingly, the countries evaluated were found to not achieve their pledged contributions with implemented policies (implementation gap), or to have an ambition gap with optimal pathways towards well below 2 °C. This shows that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries., To evaluate the effectiveness of current national policies in achieving global temperature targets is important but a systematic multi-model evaluation is still lacking. Here the authors identified a reduction of 3.5 {GtCO}2 eq of current national policies relative to a baseline scenario without climate policies by 2030 due to the increasing low carbon share of final energy and the improving final energy intensity.},

	abstract = {The Paris targets are based on assumptions that a global temperature increase of 1.5 °C−2 °C above preindustrial levels will be safe, and that the climate can be stabilized at these higher temperatures. However, global average temperatures are already measurably impacting the Earth’s systems at 1.2 °C above preindustrial levels. Many human and environmental systems cannot adapt to higher temperatures, which may exceed critical tipping points in physical climate and ecological systems. Compounding these risks is the likelihood that the international 2 °C limit will be overshot due to political obstacles and systemic inertia from existing greenhouse gases, warming oceans, and the decades required to replace existing infrastructure. Moreover, the Earth energy imbalance may have to be reduced to approximately zero to stabilize the global climate (i.e., {CO}2 concentrations lowered to around 350 ppm.) Most {IPCC} mitigation scenarios assume that climate targets will be temporarily overshot, and require large-scale carbon dioxide removal [{CDR}] to subsequently lower temperatures. However, many {CDR} methods may not be politically and/or technologically feasible, and they will act too slowly to prevent dangerous overshoot. These issues raise serious doubts about the ability of current mitigation polices to ensure safe outcomes. They also indicate the need to investigate whether rapid climate cooling measures may be required to reduce the risks associated with high temperatures during the long time it will take to decarbonize the global economy and stabilize the climate. Given the uncertainty of future mitigation success, and the potentially existential costs of failure, there is now an urgent need to examine whether or not current efforts are credible, and if not, what mitigation measures will be required to prevent dangerous overshoot and ensure a safe, stable climate. In order to develop a feasible mitigation strategy, it will be necessary to prioritize research both on climate overshoot risks, and on the relative effectiveness, risks, costs and timelines of potential mitigation and adaptation approaches. Since large scale climate interventions will be needed to prevent dangerous global warming, all plausible options need to be investigated, including carbon dioxide removal methods and technologies for rapidly cooling global temperatures. This research is a prerequisite for evaluating the comparative benefits, costs and risks of using, or not using, various forms of mitigation and adaptation, and then developing a realistic overshoot risk management plan.},

	abstract = {Can community energy help to overcome inequalities in who benefits from low-carbon technologies? Research has shown that the distribution of low-carbon technology subsidies and their associated benefits can be highly uneven across socioeconomic groups, revealing a persistent inequality issue. Yet this research has tended to focus almost exclusively on adoption of technologies at the household-level, with limited insights into whether and how this distribution might differ in the case of community energy. To address this, this paper quantitatively investigates the distribution of payments to household- and community-level energy systems across socioeconomic groups in Scotland under the {UK} government feed-in-tariff. Analysis is conducted on a novel dataset of 26,218 household and community wind and solar installations across 6,976 micro-level data-zones using a combination of distributional analysis and random effects within-between regression. It finds that feed-in-tariff payments for household-level wind and solar {PV} systems have heavily benefitted more affluent socioeconomic groups, while payments to community energy projects have flowed more consistently into areas of higher deprivation, particularly in the case of community solar. These findings suggest that community energy has been successful in bringing the benefits of low-carbon technologies to areas of lower income and higher deprivation, with important lessons for policymakers concerned with a just transition going forward.},

This paper therefore undertakes a whole-system approach and explores optimal pathways towards 100\% renewable energy by 2050. The analysis is carried out for Ireland, which currently has the highest share of variable renewable electricity on a synchronous power system. Large numbers of scenarios are developed using the Irish {TIMES} model to address uncertainties. Results show that compared to decarbonization targets, focusing on renewable penetration without considering carbon capture options is significantly less cost effective in carbon mitigation. Alternative assumptions on bioenergy imports and maximum variability in power generation lead to very different energy mixes in bioenergy and electrification levels. All pathways suggest that indigenous bioenergy needs to be fully exploited and the current annual deployment rate of renewable electricity needs a boost. Pathways relying on international bioenergy imports are slightly cheaper and faces less economic and technical challenges. However, given the large future uncertainties, it is recommended that further policy considerations be given to pathways with high electrification levels as they are more robust towards uncertainties.},

	abstract = {In energy-only electricity markets, such as Australia’s National Electricity Market ({NEM}), it has been argued that an increasing penetration of variable renewable energy ({VRE}) generation is likely to have two effects: (i) more extreme spot prices, with greater instances of both very high and very low prices and (ii) a need to increase the market price cap ({MPC}) and related price signals for reliability. This article examines the validity of both these effects using spot pricing outcomes in South Australia ({SA}), which has one of the highest {VRE} penetrations worldwide. We find partial support for these two effects. While extremely low prices have become more frequent over time, extremely high prices have become less frequent. Spot price volatility has risen, consistent with the hypothesis, but not because prices have become more extreme. Furthermore, these findings are observed for prices in all {NEM} regions, not just {SA}. Also, reliability has remained high over the past decade despite the {MPC} remaining constant in real terms. We provide four reasons why higher {VRE} penetration need not result in more extreme prices and higher {MPCs}: (i) greater investment in volatility-dampening, reliability-enhancing technologies like storage and interconnectors; (ii) increased contract cover; (iii) more price-responsive demand; and (iv) emergence of additional ancillary service revenues. These findings have implications for the durability of the {NEM}’s energy-only design given expected further increases in {VRE} penetration rates across the {NEM}.},

This debate has led to a wide range of technical reports seeking to quantify the costs and benefits of solar energy to electric utilities, ratepayers, and society at large. We review these studies, discuss the different perspectives that they represent, and identify the key variables that have shaped this value-of-solar debate.

	abstract = {A growing literature documents the effects of heat stress on premature mortality and other adverse health outcomes. Urban heat islands ({UHI}) can exacerbate these adverse impacts in cities by amplifying heat exposure during the day and inhibiting the body’s ability to recover at night. Since the {UHI} intensity varies not only across, but also within cities, intra-city variation may lead to differential impact of urban heat stress on different demographic groups. To examine these differential impacts, we combine satellite observations with census data to evaluate the relationship between distributions of both {UHI} and income at the neighborhood scale for 25 cities around the world. We find that in most (72\%) cases, poorer neighborhoods experience elevated heat exposure, an incidental consequence of the intra-city distribution of income in cities. This finding suggests that policymakers should consider designing city-specific {UHI} reduction strategies to mitigate its impacts on the most socioeconomically vulnerable populations who may be less equipped to adapt to environmental stressors. Since the strongest contributor of intra-urban {UHI} variability among the physical characteristics considered in this study is a neighborhood’s vegetation density, increasing green space in lower income neighborhoods is one strategy urban policymakers can adopt to ameliorate some of {UHI}’s inequitable burden on economically disadvantaged residents.},

Therefore, perceptions of climate change risk and vulnerability along with people’s “myths of nature”—that is, how groups of people conceptualize the way nature functions—influence the feasibility and acceptability of climate adaptation planning, policy making, and implementation. This study presents analyses of cultural worldviews that broaden the current treatments of culture and climate change mitigation and adaptation decision making in communities. The authors use insights from community-based climate research and engage the Cultural Theory of Risk conceptual framework to situate community understandings of, and responses to, climate impacts. This study looks at how the issue of climate change manifests socially in four cases in the United States and Tuvalu and how ideas about climate change are produced by the institutional cultural contexts across scales from the local to the global. This approach helps us identify local and regional priorities and support the development of new relationships for adaptation research and planning by helping to diagnose barriers to climate change adaptation, assist improved communication through framing/reframing climate issues based on shared understandings and collective learning, and help move from conflict to cooperation through better negotiation of diverse worldviews.},

Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

To this end, a new U.S. consumer survey probes core attitudes about the reliability, affordability and environmental impact of energy. Appended quarterly to the long-running monthly survey of 500 households that produces the Index of Consumer Sentiment, this instrument inherits the sample design and statistical rigor of that household economic survey. First-year results yield several notable findings. Home energy bills are viewed as unaffordable if they were to double for consumers in the lower income tercile but only if they were to triple for consumers in the upper income tercile. Regarding the cost increases deemed unaffordable, consumers report much greater sensitivity to higher gasoline prices than to higher home energy bills. Moreover, consumers express at least as much concern about the environmental impact of energy as they do about its affordability, a result that shows some regional variation but which holds across income brackets. Several other findings are of likely interest to energy researchers and policymakers, and the unique data series generated by this survey will enable deeper analyses of attitudinally related energy topics as time goes on.},

	abstract = {Based on data from a large-scale survey (n=3400) conducted in Germany, we analyze citizens’ acceptance and protest intentions regarding the construction of new power plants for renewable energy production. We differentiate between wind energy, solar energy, and biomass energy; natural gas is used as a reference category. We measure protest intentions and acceptance regarding the construction of new power plants within a 10-kilometer radius of respondents’ place of residence. Protest and acceptance are explained by several competing theoretical determinants such as specific attitudes towards each energy source, general attitudes towards climate change, social norms, the “not-in-my-backyard” phenomenon, place attachment, and conditional cooperation. We use decomposition models used in labor market research to study endowment, discrimination, and characteristics effects related to different attitudinal dimensions and their influence on acceptance and protest intentions. Our results show more positive attitudes, less protest intentions, and a stronger acceptance of solar energy, followed by wind energy, biomass energy, and natural gas. Theory comparison reveals, for instance, that “not-in-my-backyard” beliefs have high explanatory power, climate change concern is only relevant for the acceptance of wind energy and solar energy, and place attachment seems to be a useful concept for explaining protest intentions. The decomposition models indicate that attitudes are strong determinants of acceptance and protest intentions where, in addition to endowment effects, we also find some indications of discrimination effects (i.e., different weights of attitudinal dimensions) and characteristics effects (i.e., effects of respondents’ characteristics). Finally, we discuss the policy implications of these results.},

	abstract = {Governments in several European countries have developed policies that encourage companies to share ownership of renewable energy projects with local communities. Shared ownership presumes that company and community actors have common goals, can form effective partnerships and negotiate fair outcomes. But there is a lack of research on shared ownership, in particular, how it is constructed by different actors, and the role of trust in shaping practice. This study addressed this gap, drawing on qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 19 {UK} stakeholders from industry, community and advisory backgrounds. Thematic analysis revealed strong support for shared ownership in principle, but significant challenges in practice. Actors held different rationales and contrasting views on whether the policy should be discretionary or mandatory. A lack of trust was prevalent, with developers expressing skepticism regarding the capacities and representativeness of community actors; and community actors viewing developers as solely motivated by profit, instrumentally using communities to gain planning consent. We conclude that for shared ownership to become conventional practice, it will be necessary to provide mechanisms that facilitate partner identification at an early stage, which can help to build relations of trust between actors, within a more stable and supportive policy context.},

This mixed methods study employed in-depth interviews (n=54) and surveys (n=252) with multiple stakeholder groups to understand perceptions of procedural justice across two Canadian provinces. We compared Ontario – which has built a strong base of wind energy capacity using technocratic siting procedures with Nova Scotia – which has anchored its development strategy more explicitly with a community-based program. We find stronger levels of perceived procedural justice in Nova Scotia across the majority of principles tested. In Ontario, opposition to local developments was highly conflated with a lack of procedural justice including few opportunities to take part in siting. Across both provinces however, specific aspects of planning processes – mostly related to ‘the ability to affect the outcome’ – were strong predictors of local approval of wind. This paper closes with a discussion of how future policy programs can more effectively engage with principles of procedural justice.},

Here, we examine the results of a 2013 mail survey of individuals residing in the vicinity of a 2MW wind turbine that is located on the edge of the historic coastal town of Lewes, Delaware in the United States, and adjacent to Delaware Bay and the Great Marsh Preserve. The wind turbine, which was constructed in 2010, primarily serves the University of Delaware's coastal campus, and to a lesser extent the town of Lewes. Seventy-eight percent hold positive or very positive attitudes toward the wind turbine, with only 10\% having negative or very negative attitudes, and 82\% like the look of the wind turbine. Socially constructed aspects find more resonance than physical ones (e.g., attractiveness) in explaining this latter finding, with the wind turbine being reflective of a transformation to a clean energy future for those residents who like the way the turbine looks. On the other hand, those objecting to its look, find the turbine does not fit the landscape. Policy implications of these findings and others related to wind turbine sound are considered, and recommendations for better understanding of proposed developments from the vantage point of the affected communities, including how a community views itself and its surrounding landscape, are made.},

It is a collection of best papers presented at an international research conference held in Tramelan (Switzerland) in February 2006. While there are ambitious government targets to increase the share of renewable energy in many countries, it is increasingly recognized that social acceptance may be a constraining factor in achieving this target. This is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy, which has become a subject of contested debates in several countries largely due to its visual impact on landscapes. This paper introduces three dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political, community and market acceptance. Factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important for understanding the apparent contradictions between general public support for renewable energy innovation and the difficult realization of specific projects. The third dimension, market acceptance, has received less attention so far and provides opportunities for further research, particularly from management scholars.},

Two dimensions of trust are relevant in this respect: competence-based and integrity-based trust. Yet, the unique and interaction effects of these two dimensions of trust on project acceptability are not well understood. We conducted two experimental studies to test these effects in China and the Netherlands. As expected, higher integrity-based trust in responsible agents led to higher project acceptability in both countries. Notably, these effects were independent of the level of competence-based trust. Competence-based trust enhanced project acceptability only in China and only when integrity-based trust was low. Mediation analyses further showed that (part of) the effects of both dimensions of trust on project acceptability could be explained by people's perceptions of how the decisions were made, in both countries. Results suggest that integrity-based trust has a more profound effect on project acceptability.},

	abstract = {The low carbon transition is fraught with challenges for policy makers, not least the social acceptance of large-scale infrastructure. In response to community objections, the distribution of benefit funds has become increasingly prevalent as a means to bolster acceptance. However, little research has investigated the spatiality of benefit provision - where boundaries are drawn that define the ‘locality’ of a project and who is eligible to benefit. Using a high voltage power line in Ireland as a case study, this paper investigates how the boundaries of the community fund were identified, contested, negotiated and implemented. It draws on a qualitative dataset comprising secondary materials, observation and in-depth interviews with the stakeholders administering the fund and both successful and unsuccessful community applicants. Stakeholders justified boundary setting as essential for efficient and equitable fund distribution, founded upon discourses of impact and proximity. Those administering the fund mixed objectivity and subjectivity, departing from a logical, formulaic approach to identify the locality of the project before revising it in response to ‘reasonable’ local knowledge and interests. The outcome was a boundary that was widely acknowledged to be imperfect, yet legitimate and fair. Community groups recognised the fund both as an instrumental tool to secure their acceptance and as a means to mitigate impact and share benefit, provided it served their interests. Application of the boundary in fund decision-making revealed inherent difficulties in putting abstract definitions of ‘locality’ into practice as well as tensions between values of meritocracy and distributional equity. We discuss the applicability of the findings to non-linear energy projects (e.g. wind farms) and propose recommendations to optimise legitimacy and fairness in drawing boundaries for community benefit provision.},

Spatial decision-support tools are being developed and applied to tackle some of these challenges by facilitating systematic identification of suitable development sites based on technical, environmental and socio-economic criteria. Nevertheless, decision-support tools are often developed with limited input from stakeholders affecting participative and accountable planning and decision-making. This paper aims to address this shortcoming and foster greater transparency in the development of support tools for renewable energy planning, and thus in siting decisions. It present and discusses a stakeholder-driven approach to the co-creation of an online decision-support tool that attends to planning policy, technical considerations, environmental protection and social concerns influencing renewable energy planning decisions in Ireland. This bottom-up approach, easily transferable to other jurisdictions, fosters proactive expert input, awareness raising and greater comprehensibility and acceptance of siting decisions. It also enables developing an interface that responds to users’ needs. The paper contributes to advancing renewable energy planning practice through effective and meaningful stakeholder engagement that supports transparent and accountable decisions from the outset. It also highlights ongoing data and technological shortcomings affecting the integration and operationalisation of stakeholders demands and needs, which signal priority areas of action to further advance the development of renewable energy decision-support tools.},

To suggest how it can do so, we analyze existing state- and county-level siting processes in Washington state, finding that both fall short on measures of procedural justice. To overcome this limitation and address the tension between procedural justice and project development, we then propose a collaborative governance approach to wind facility siting, in which state governments retain ultimate authority over permitting decisions but encourage and support local-level deliberations as the primary means of making those decisions. Such an approach, we argue, would be more just, facilitate wind development by addressing community concerns constructively and result in better projects through the input of diverse stakeholders.},

While the transition towards {RES}-based energy systems is largely perceived positively in general, locally both {RES} and grid expansion are often confronted with a lack of public acceptance. Using Germany as a case study, we analyse public acceptance of energy infrastructure and its main drivers on local vs. national levels. For this purpose, we conducted a nationally representative survey. Our results show that, on a national level, the acceptance of {RES} is very high and there is also a high acceptance of grid expansion if it helps to increase the share of {RES} in the system. In terms of local acceptance problems that may arise for most considered technologies, concerns about landscape modification turn out to be the main driving factor. Moreover, the distance between places of residence and places of energy infrastructure construction is crucial. While acceptance or rejection of technologies will never be entirely tangible or explicable, we find the explicability of rejections to be lowest for new technologies. Finally, age and education turn out to be the most relevant socio-demographic variables determining the participants' acceptance.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a framework is proposed which aims at including social acceptance as an integral component of planning of large scale technologies. To date, social acceptance is often considered only in the final stage of the planning process, if at all. It will be argued that acceptance-relevant factors should be integrated during the whole process in order to include the public and coordinate acceptance and planning in combination. In order to achieve this, a social gap in the planning of complex energy infrastructure needs to be closed. The social gap presents itself in a twofold manner: one issue is the critical analysis of the general measurability of acceptance factors referring to the question if it is possible to operationalize and predict social acceptance reliably. The second “gap” refers to the lack of integration of results from acceptance research into current planning procedures. Taking wind farm planning as an example, the two gaps are discussed and a new, integrative planning model is advocated. Finally, requirements for a user-centered planning procedure are derived.},

	abstract = {Public participation in decision making has been widely advocated by scholars and practitioners as a remedy for public resistance against sustainable energy projects. Yet, it is unclear via which processes public participation in decision making may affect public acceptability of energy projects. We hypothesize that public participation in decision making is likely to increase project acceptability when it enhances perceived procedural fairness. Moreover, we hypothesize that perceived procedural fairness is higher when people can participate and influence major rather than only minor aspects of the project. We conducted three experimental studies in the Netherlands to test these hypotheses, with renewable energy projects as a case in point. As expected, public participation in decision making increased perceived procedural fairness, particularly when people could influence major aspects of the project. In turn, higher perceived procedural fairness enhanced public acceptability of the projects. Interestingly, when controlling for perceived procedural fairness, public participation in decision making had no effect (Study 2) and even a negative effect (Study 1 and 3) on project acceptability, particularly when people could influence major aspects. We conclude that public participation in decision making can enhance project acceptability if people can influence major aspects and perceive the decision making as fair. Next, our findings point out that there may be other processes instigated by public participation in decision making that can influence project acceptability. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

The literature on {ED} tends to associate greater democratic control of energy systems with increased community control over the means of energy generation and distribution. Nonetheless, this literature often assumes rather than demonstrates that the forms of governance it promotes are more democratic than the status quo. This analysis contributes to the emerging field of {ED} by assessing the complex and varied ways in which communities in Scotland practise energy governance. By focusing on three key governance processes (decision-making, accountability and dispute resolution), the importance of local contexts for the establishment and negotiation of democratic practices is demonstrated. This local specificity, however, also raises further questions regarding the universal applicability of the {ED} concept.},

	abstract = {To achieve a successful energy transition, it is vital to integrate citizens’ needs into government policies through participatory processes. However,offline participatory approaches can be overly intensive which leads to an over-representation of citizens who think that the issue is in their immediate interest. Hence, elected officials often question the extent to which participants’ priorities are a good proxy to represent “the public”.Participatory Value Evaluation ({PVE}) potentially circumvents this by allowing a large and diverse group of citizens to advise their government in an accessible manner. In an online environment, citizens step into the shoes of a policy maker and see which policy options the government considers, while being informed about the impacts. Next, they are asked to provide advice. Because {PVE} was originally designed as an economic evaluation method, it is unclear whether it can be deployed for effective participation.This study investigates how {PVE} could be deployed for effective participation of citizens in the energy transition through a real-world experiment in the Netherlands. We aimed to conduct the {PVE} in line with goals of stakeholders which is the most important requirement for effective participation. We fully achieved three goals that were defined by stakeholders: {PVE} enables participation of people that normally do not participate (particularly young people); low time investment of civil servants; outcomes of a {PVE} should be useful for decision-making. We partly achieved two goals: {PVE} raises awareness among citizens about decisions and implications of the energy transition; participation should be meaningful for citizens.},

The aims and objectives of this study are threefold: to interrogate which sociotechnical concepts or tools from {STS} are useful at better understanding energy-related social science, to reflect on prominent themes and topics within those approaches, and to identify current research gaps and directions for the future. To do so, the study builds on a companion project, a systematic analysis of 262 articles published from 2009 to mid-2019 that categorized and reviewed sociotechnical perspectives in energy social science. It identifies future research directions by employing the method of “co-creation” based on the reflections of sixteen prominent researchers in the field in late 2019 and early 2020. Drawing from this co-created synthesis, this study first identifies three main areas of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research (sociotechnical systems, policy, and expertise and publics) with 15 topics and 39 subareas. The study then identifies five main themes for the future development of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research: conditions of systematic change; embedded agency; justice, power, identity and politics; imaginaries and discourses; and public engagement and governance. It also points to the recognized need for pluralism and parallax: for research to show greater attention to demographic and geographical diversity; to stronger research designs; to greater theoretical triangulation; and to more transdisciplinary approaches.},

Embodied energy injustices reframe considerations of energy justice to explicitly consider hidden and distant injustices (upstream or downstream) arising from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem, Massachusetts, {US}, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power station. Cerrejón open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But the regulatory environment fails to account for the different constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects, which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy injustice—by revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel supply chains—may help generate and unite powerful trans-local solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider national, regional and global energy politics.},

However, to date community acceptance research has concentrated on responses to actual proposals, seeking to explain local objections. ‘Upstream’ research that investigates the ‘place-technology fit’ of a potential renewable energy project before it is proposed is scarce, yet can inform technology deployment by taking local knowledge and preferences into account. We address this gap in a study conducted in Guernsey, Channel Islands. Data was collected using a survey (n = 468) co-designed with island policy makers presenting technical, economic and locational details of a potential offshore wind project. Results show that acceptance of the same project design differed significantly across alternative development locations. Regression analyses compared the roles of personal, context and project-related factors in explaining acceptance for each site. Support for using wind energy for local electricity supply was the most important predictor of acceptance, and this variable mediated the relationship between island energy security and community acceptance. We conclude that place matters for community acceptance and that security and autonomy are co-benefits of local renewable energy projects that deserve further research.},

We found original licenses had shorter average timelines than relicenses and project capacity was only related to timeline length when license type (i.e., original, relicense) was included in analyses. Both licensing timeline length and variability were impacted by the licensing process (Alternative, Integrated, Traditional) used. Projects with greater environmental complexity (e.g., endangered species) had significantly longer timelines than projects that were less environmentally complex. We attributed shorter timelines for original licenses to lower environmental complexity (e.g., no endangered species) because most original licenses involved development of already impacted sites. Projects with greater environmental complexity significantly impact resources that may require greater stakeholder involvement and increased study that can lead to longer licensing timelines.},

	abstract = {Two of the most widely emphasized contenders for carbon emissions reduction in the electricity sector are nuclear power and renewable energy. While scenarios regularly question the potential impacts of adoption of various technology mixes in the future, it is less clear which technology has been associated with greater historical emission reductions. Here, we use multiple regression analyses on global datasets of national carbon emissions and renewable and nuclear electricity production across 123 countries over 25 years to examine systematically patterns in how countries variously using nuclear power and renewables contrastingly show higher or lower carbon emissions. We find that larger-scale national nuclear attachments do not tend to associate with significantly lower carbon emissions while renewables do. We also find a negative association between the scales of national nuclear and renewables attachments. This suggests nuclear and renewables attachments tend to crowd each other out.},

The knowledge of the share of coal, gas and oil in electricity generation permits the exact calculation of the related {CO}2 emissions. In addition, there is a second approach especially within the economic sciences, which applies statistical techniques for the study of the energy-related emissions. The background for these studies is the provision of general political advice and the expectation that political, cultural, or infrastructural considerations guide nations in the preference and choice of specific technologies. In this paper, we are applying both approaches and come to the certain conclusion, that nuclear power is as effective as renewable power in order to reduce the {CO}2 emissions. Our results are in complete contradiction to a recent publication (Sovacool et al. in Nat Energy 5:928–935, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-020-00696-3). The authors of this paper conclude that nuclear power does not reduce the {CO}2 emissions, but renewable power efficiently does. In addition, they argue that these two technologies crowd out each other. The possible reason for their claims may result from a specific conditioning of the data. In contrast, our analysis clearly confirms the adequacy of both nuclear and renewable power generation.},

To shed light on this question, we undertook a study of perceptions of mainland coastal and island residents proximate to the Block Island project—the first offshore wind project in the United States. The study included a longitudinal survey of residents prior to and after turbine installation, and semi-structured interviews with residents and key stakeholders. We assessed the extent to which respondents were engaged in the planning process, opinions of transparency and fairness, and degree to which the planning process affected their opinion. Although interviewees who held a negative view of state government indicated that it did not cause them to oppose the project, trust in state government was the primary driver of perceptions of process fairness, which in turn was the primary driver of project support. We also found individuals to withhold final judgment of the process until the final outcome—project operation. Finally, fair process was seen as having benefits distinct from its effect on the outcome—that is, local residents valued the process itself.},

	abstract = {The renewable energy projects involve multiple stakeholders; the social acceptance of these projects may convert into a thoughtful risk for the exploitation of renewable energy. Comprehending the process under which a social license to operate may be granted to a renewable energy project is significant. The “{GO}” or “{NO}-{GO}” decision for a renewable energy project is a vital task. In order to illustrate how renewable energy projects can be assessed from the sustainability point of view, two hypothetical scenarios were constructed. These scenarios describe a conceptual renewable energy project evaluated by five imaginary stakeholders under specific criteria and sustainability pillars. The first scenario is a “{NO}-{GO}” scenario: the project is not sustainable due to significant environmental, social, economic, technological and geopolitical negative impacts. In this case, the social license to operate will not be endorsed by the stakeholders; important changes are needed before reassessment. The second scenario is a “{GO}” scenario: the preferences of the stakeholders are such that the project may be considered sustainable and the social license to operate may be endorsed by the stakeholders. The methodology utilized to assess the two hypothetical scenarios for the same renewable energy project is the multi-criteria decision analysis combined with the multi-attribute utility theory. The quantification of assessment results was conducted with the assistance of a state-of-the-art decision support system (“Acropolis {DSS}”), which allows decision-makers to evaluate multiple options that offer alternate solutions in “{GO}-{NO}-{GO}” situations.},

Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment ({EROI}). The {EROI} of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and non-conventional energy alternatives have substantially lower {EROI} values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining {EROI} means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for “non-essential” purchases which often drive growth. The declining {EROI} of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.},

Energy Return on Investment ({EROI}) is a popular metric to assess the profitability of energy extraction processes, with {EROI} {\textgreater} 1 indicating that more energy is delivered to society than is used in the extraction process. Over the past decade, {EROI} analysis in particular has grown in popularity, resulting in an increase in publications in recent years. The lack of methodological consistency, however, among these papers has led to a situation where inappropriate comparisons are being made across technologies. In this paper we provide both a literature review and harmonization of {EROI} values to provide accurate comparisons of {EROIs} across both thermal fuels and electricity producing technologies. Most importantly, the authors advocate for the use of point-of-use {EROIs} rather than point-of-extraction {EROIs} as the energy “cost” of the processes to get most thermal fuels from extraction to point of use drastically lowers their {EROI}. The main results indicate that {PV}, wind and hydropower have {EROIs} at or above ten while the {EROIs} for thermal fuels vary significantly, with that for petroleum oil notably below ten.},

Risk-perception research has recently begun to provide a new perspective on this problem. Distrust in risk analysis and risk management plays a central role in this perspective. According to this view, the conflicts and controversies surrounding risk management are not due to public ignorance or irrationality but, instead, are seen as a side effect of our remarkable form of participatory democracy, amplified by powerful technological and social changes that systematically destroy trust. Recognizing the importance of trust and understanding the “dynamics of the system” that destroys trust has vast implications for how we approach risk management in the future.},

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with regulating safety in nuclear power plants, has recently tackled the safety question directly, by adopting "safety goals" that facilities must meet. The {NRC}'s approach proves to be sophisticated in some respects, incomplete in others. More generally, it points up the inherent difficulties that exist with the concept of "acceptable risk" and with any attempt to build policy instruments around it.

A classification of {ITM} goals is developed based on two types of sociotechnical transition goals (developing alternative technologies and ending existing technologies) and two types of societal change goals (the democratization of industrial organizations and political processes and the equitable access to jobs and industrial products). The study of processes and outcomes of {ITMs} also has implications for social movement theory, which are outlined. This approach enables a comprehensive analysis of the relations among the state, industry, civil society, and social movements that can identify causal mechanisms in the effects of social movements on industrial transitions and energy democracy.},

	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Most evolutionary many-objective optimization ({EMaO}) algorithms start with a description of a number of predeﬁned set of reference points on a unit simplex. So far, most studies have used the Das and Dennis’s structured approach for generating well-spaced reference points. Due to the highly structured nature of the procedure, this method cannot produce an arbitrary number of points, which is desired in an {EMaO} application. Although a layer-wise implementation has been suggested, {EMO} researchers always felt the need for a more generic approach. Motivated by earlier studies, we introduce a metric for deﬁning well-spaced points on a unit simplex and propose a number of viable methods for generating such a set. We compare the proposed methods on a variety of performance metrics such as hypervolume, deviation in triangularized simplices, distance of the closest point pair, and variance of the geometric means to nearest neighbors in up to 15-dimensional spaces. We show that an iterative improvement based on Riesz s-Energy is able to effectively ﬁnd an arbitrary number of wellspaced points even in higher-dimensional spaces. Reference points created using the proposed Riesz s-Energy method for a number of standard combinations of objectives and reference points as well as a source code written in Python are available publicly at https://www.egr.msu.edu/coinlab/blankjul/uniform.},

Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following {NSGA}-{II} framework (we call it {NSGA}-{III}) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed {NSGA}-{III} is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested {EMO} algorithm ({MOEA}/D). While each of the two {MOEA}/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed {NSGA}-{III} is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Addressing climate change requires societies to transition away from fossil fuels toward low-carbon energy, including renewables. Unfortunately, large wind projects have proven politically controversial, with groups opposing them across advanced economies. To date, there are few large-scale, systematic studies to identify the prevalence and predictors of opposition to wind energy projects. Here, we analyzed a dataset of wind energy projects across the United States and Canada between 2000 and 2016. We found that during this period, in the United States, 17\% of wind projects faced significant opposition, and in Canada, 18\% faced opposition, with rates in both countries growing over time. Opposition was concentrated regionally in the Northeastern United States and in Ontario, Canada. In both countries, larger projects with more turbines were more likely to be opposed. In the United States, opposition was more likely and more intense in areas with a higher proportion of White people, and a smaller proportion of Hispanic people. In Canada, opposition was more likely and more intense in wealthier communities. The most common tactics used to oppose wind energy were court cases, legislation, and physical protests. The number of people engaging in opposition to wind projects is likely small: Across articles that cited the number of individuals engaging in protests, the median number was 23 in the United States and 34 in Canada. When wealthier, Whiter communities oppose wind projects, this slows down the transition away from fossil fuel projects in poorer communities and communities of color, an environmental injustice we call “energy privilege.”},

	abstract = {This study critically examines 20 years of geography and political ecology literature on the energy justice implications of climate change mitigation. Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions—including renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management—with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies, multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake. Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon world more pluralistic, democratic, and just.},

The research highlights an urgent need for targeted macro-level planning as global markets see a decline in thermal coal and a ramp up of other mining commodities. Our findings suggest that ramping up energy transition metals ({ETM}) could be more disruptive to demographic systems than ramping down coal. The data shows asymmetry in the distribution of risks: mine-town systems within the United States are most sensitive to coal phase-out, while systems in Australia and Canada are most sensitive to {ETM} phase-in. A complete phase-out of coal could disrupt demographic systems with a minimum of 33.5 million people, and another 115.7 million people if all available {ETM} projects enter production.},

In this study, we rely on a mixed methods research design involving household solar interviews (N = 24), site visits (N = 4 solar neighbourhoods), and a literature review to investigate four types of inequities associated with household solar adoption. We utilize a novel framework looking at demographic inequities (between groups), spatial inequities (across geographic scales), interspecies inequities (between humans and non-humans), and temporal inequities (across present and future generations). This framework enables not only the identification of multiple and often interlinked inequities; it also points the way towards how to make solar energy adoption more sustainable and just, with direct implications for solar business practices (and supply chains) as well as energy and climate policy.},

The broad themes of our framework are (i) politics, space and institutions, with sub-themes of justice, democracy, financialization; (ii) new processes and procedures, with sub-themes of legal recognition of public concerns, community-based planning, community capacity enhancement and life cycle impact assessment; and (iii) correlates of acceptance and resistance, with sub-themes of environmental values, perceived loss of amenity, pre-existing politics, perceptions of just process and trust in the developer.

	abstract = {We introduce the new concept of embodied energy injustices in order to encourage integrative, systemic, transboundary assessment of the global implications and responsibility of energy-policy decisions. Embodied energy injustices reframe considerations of energy justice to explicitly consider hidden and distant injustices (upstream or downstream) arising from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem, Massachusetts, {US}, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power station. Cerrejón open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But the regulatory environment fails to account for the different constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects, which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy injustice—by revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel supply chains—may help generate and unite powerful trans-local solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider national, regional and global energy politics.},

	shorttitle = {Decarbonization and Its Discontents},
	abstract = {Low-carbon transitions are often assumed as positive phenomena, because they supposedly reduce carbon emissions, yet without vigilance, there is evidence that they can in fact create new injustices and vulnerabilities, while also failing to address pre-existing structural drivers of injustice in energy markets and the wider socio-economy. With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an “energy justice” framework consisting of four distinct dimensions — distributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions — nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany — through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert participants as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve large internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.},

Based on extensive, original mixed methods empirical research – including expert interviews, focus groups, internet forums, community interviews, and extended site visits and naturalistic observation – it asks: How are four specific decarbonisation pathways linked to negative impacts within specific communities? Relatedly, what vulnerabilities do these transitions exacerbate in these communities? Lastly, how can such vulnerabilities be better addressed with policy? The paper documents a troublesome cohabitation between French wineries and nuclear power, the negative effects on labor groups and workers in Eastern Germany by a transition to solar energy, the stark embodied externalities in electronic waste (e-waste) flows from smart meters accumulating in Ghana, and the precarious exploitation of children involved in cobalt mining for electric vehicle batteries in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The aims and objectives of the study are threefold: (1) to showcase how four very different vulnerable communities have been affected by the negative impacts of decarbonisation; (2) to reveal tensions and tradeoffs between European transitions and local and global justice concerns; and (3) to inform energy and climate policy. In identifying these objectives, our goal is not to stop or slow down all low-carbon transitions. Rather, the study suggests that the research and policy communities ought to account for, and seek to minimize, a broader range of social and environmental sustainability risks. Sustainability transitions and decarbonisation pathways must become more egalitarian, fair, and just.},

This paper conducts a whole systems energy justice analysis of four European low-carbon transitions—nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar photovoltaic panels in Germany. It asks: in what ways may each of these transitions result in injustices that extend beyond communities and countries, i.e., across the whole system? It utilizes a mixed-methods research design based on 64 semi-structured research interviews with experts across all four transitions, five public focus groups, and the collection of 58 comments from twelve public internet forums to answer this question. Drawing inductively from these data, the paper identifies and analyzes 44 injustices spread across three spatial scales. Micro scale injustices concern immediate local impacts on family livelihood, community health and the environment. Meso scale injustices include national-scale issues such as rising prices for electricity and gas or unequal access to low-carbon technology. Macro scale injustices include global issues such as the extraction of minerals and metals and the circulation of waste flows. The paper then discusses these collective injustices in terms of their spatiality and temporality, before offering conclusions for energy and climate research and policy.},

It defines “energy justice” as a global energy system that fairly distributes both the benefits and burdens of energy services, and one that contributes to more representative and inclusive energy decision-making. The primary contribution of the article is its focus on six new frontiers of future energy justice research. First is making the case for the involvement of non-Western justice theorists. Second is expanding beyond humans to look at the Rights of Nature or non-anthropocentric notions of justice. Third is focusing on cross-scalar issues of justice such as embodied emissions. Fourth is identifying business models and the co-benefits of justice. Fifth is better understanding the tradeoffs within energy justice principles. Sixth is exposing unjust discourses. In doing so, the article presents an agenda constituted by 30 research questions as well as an amended conceptual framework consisting of ten principles. The article argues in favor of “justice-aware” energy planning and policymaking, and it hopes that its (reconsidered) energy justice conceptual framework offers a critical tool to inform decision-making.},

	abstract = {Growth in renewable energy does not displace fossil fuel use on a one-to-one basis, but rather increases the total amount of energy that is produced. As numerous scholars have argued, an energy transition away from – rather than in addition to – fossil fuels will require more than technology and financial capital. Here we argue that a feminist perspective on energy provides an important framework for understanding what keeps us stuck in unsustainable energy cultures, as well as a paradigm for designing truly just energy systems. Feminist approaches have been widely taken up in environmental and ecofeminist work, as well as in climate change research. In energy studies, however, gender-related research has tended to focus more narrowly on women's issues. Although this is crucial work, the focus on women represents just one dimension of what feminism can bring to the study of energy. Feminist theory also offers expertise in the study of power more broadly, which is widely applicable to the full spectrum of energy research. This article outlines a feminist energy research agenda that addresses many aspects of energy system design, planning, exchange, and use. We analyze energy along four intersecting coordinates: the political (democratic, decentralized and pluralist); economic (prioritizing human well-being and biodiversity over profit and unlimited growth); socio-ecological (preferring relationality over individualism); and technological (privileging distributed and decentralized fuel power and people power). In doing so, we show that feminism is well-suited for navigating the tangled web of power, profit, and technological innovation that comprises human fuel use.},

Since the first nuclear detonation (Trinity test) and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all in 1945, nuclear technology has profoundly affected world history and geopolitics, as well as our daily life and natural world. It has always been an instrument for national security, a marker of national sovereignty, a site of technological innovation and a promise of energy abundance. It has also introduced permanent pollution and the age of the Anthropocene. This volume presents a new perspective on nuclear history and politics by focusing on four interconnected themes–violence and survival; control and containment; normalizing through denial and presumptions; memories and futures–and exploring their relationships and consequences. It proposes an original reflection on nuclear technology from a long-term, comparative and transnational perspective. It brings together contributions from researchers from different disciplines (anthropology, history, {STS}) and countries ({US}, France, Japan) on a variety of local, national and transnational subjects. Finally, this book offers an important and valuable insight into other global and Anthropocene challenges such as climate change.},

The promise of civilian atomic energy was a formidable tool of state power in the late twentieth century because it took advantage of social aspirations, anxieties, and environmental vulnerabilities, especially in the developing world. The deployment of rhetoric to promote atomic energy was inseparable from geopolitics writ large and has rarely been entirely peaceful. Instead it has been embedded in stories of conventional warfare, racial and neocolonial divisiveness, struggles to assert control over the earth’s natural resources, and the abetting of nuclear weapons programs both old and new.},

These materials extend the impact of decisions made today into a far distant future, raising difficult questions regarding intergenerational and intragenerational social justice, ethical responsibility, and collective decision-making. This essay critically reviews those challenges using resources from the fields of communication and rhetoric, sociologies and philosophies of temporality and risk, and science and technology studies. The essay argues that modern notions of prediction, control, and decision-making are inadequate for addressing such highly complex phenomena and long temporal durations. Nuclear waste disposal is then examined as an activity that seeks not only to contain material hazards, but also to symbolically purify the system of nuclear production and consumption. The proposed U.S. nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain provides an example in which predictive models, which warrant both epistemic and political authority, are nevertheless insufficient bases for collective decision-making. The essay then considers the situation in the United States, where a new political economy of nuclear waste appears to be emerging, and offers summary conclusions regarding nuclear power and social justice.},

	abstract = {Anti-nuclear activism demonstrates the significant challenges of uniting India under a shared ‘civic epistemology' – a modality of collective public reasoning that binds the state and polities together through institutionally mediated practices of vetting policy-relevant knowledge and expertise. This article argues that Indian nuclear politics is better understood through the lens of politico-epistemological upheaval instead of a shared civic epistemology, understood as a byproduct of hegemonic relations between the state and civil society. Civic epistemologies must account for the failures of the Indian bourgeoisie and state in achieving hegemony through nuclear nationalism, and contend with how coercive state power circumscribes consensual politics and is often directed towards subaltern groups ambivalently enrolled in India’s nation-building project. The ongoing political debilitation and sometimes death of activists who are deemed anti-state or anti-development underscore the need to construct socially robust processes of producing more just and inclusive civic epistemologies.},

	abstract = {A recent American “mini-series” on Chernobyl, widely watched across the world, presented viewers with the concluding finding that this massive accident had occurred because the reactor design had inherent flaws; flaws that were known but not previously fixed because it was “cheaper” that way. The reactor design in question is the {RBMK}, and this paper will argue that this design was far from “cheap,” neither then nor now, and that its adoption as the second standard design for the Soviet Union’s nuclear power reactor fleet was based on much more than economic considerations. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to forget that reactor designs are always chosen for a multitude of reasons and never solely based on their technical or economic merits. Based on archival research, interviews, and industry publications, I show that approving and building {RBMK} reactors made good sense at the time, despite later claims to the contrary. Then I take the examples of a small modular reactor ({SMR}), the proposed {NuScale} Power Module, and a fast neutron reactor, {TerraPower}’s proposed Traveling Wave Reactor, to argue that we witness comparable negotiations today, as new designs for reactors (1) attempt to fit into existing safety and regulatory frameworks, (2) navigate security and nonproliferation concerns, and (3) embody visions of a specific sociotechnical order. I conclude that technical designs never occur in a socioeconomic, political, or cultural vacuum; instead, they are developed by people steeped in social norms, regulatory concerns, and economic expectations of a specific time and place. In the spirit of making this point relevant to practitioners, I will suggest ways of making these implicit frameworks visible, to actively and consciously start tweaking them, while staying aware of the implications that technical choices may have on our social expectations and vice versa.},

	abstract = {Historically, energy and climate research have failed to fully integrate research from the social sciences. This is problematic as the development of energy systems and the rapid acceleration of climate change are directly tied to human activity. When the social sciences are incorporated in energy and climate research, their scope is frequently economically oriented. Methodological approaches remain frequently quantitative in nature. While important, these approaches cannot fully capture the nuances of power, inequality, and justice within decisionmaking processes that create and constitute our energy systems and subsequent climate change impacts and outcomes. As energy decisions and policies continue to increasingly shape the extent to which the world is impacted by climate change, we must think precisely about the complexity of identity and who is involved in energy decisions; who benefits from, and who is burdened by particular sets of energy decisions and the impacts of climate change. In addition, we must examine how these burdens and benefits manifest differently based on individual and group identities. To ignore these questions creates a research field where social actors and organizations remain decoupled from their role and responsibilities in the construction of and participation in these energy systems; where the embeddedness of a system is taken for granted, remains unscrutinized and unchallenged, and acts as a path-dependent barrier to the envisioning and building of an alternative energy future. In order to strengthen energy and climate change research and policy we must engage in research methods that can better account for underlying issues of power and justice within the decisionmaking processes across multiple socio-political scales. More specifically in this paper, I argue that using qualitative methodological tools rooted in intersectional feminist theory, such as a multi-sited critical policy ehtnography, are a crucial way to do so.},

The decision in favour of a specific method is understood as a political decision, which influences our capacity not only to examine dominant perspectives and processes, but also to explore invisible and silenced elements, actors and positions in energy cultures. The critical question under investigation is how transformation processes of the way we produce, use and distribute energy can be initiated that entail political as well as scientific practices and processes in which diversity, complexity and modes of reflection are inscribed? Based on the example of energy research governance in the European Union, the article explores how situational analysis with its distinct mapping tools supports the researcher to debate and reflect on simplifications, complexity and power relations, while simultaneously critically asses the problems and challenges of the method.},

In this study we address research gaps in historical and current ambient air emissions burdens in environmental justice communities from power plants participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gases Initiative ({RGGI}), the country’s first market-based power sector emissions reduction program. We find that in {RGGI} states the percentage of people of color that live within 0–6.2 miles from power plants is up to 23.5 percent higher than the percent of the white population that lives within those same distance bands, and the percentage of people living in poverty that live within 0–5 miles from power plants is up to 15.3 percent higher than the percent of the population not living in poverty within those same distance bands. More importantly, the transition from coal to natural gas underway before {RGGI} formally started resulted in large increases in both the number of electric-generating units burning natural gas and total net generation from natural gas in environmental justice communities hosting electric-generating units, compared to other communities. Our findings indicate that power sector carbon mitigation policies’ focusing on aggregate emissions reductions have largely benefitted non-environmental justice communities and have not redressed the fundamental problem of disparities in pollutant burdens between {EJ} and non-{EJ} communities. These must be directly addressed in climate change and carbon emissions mitigation policy.},

	abstract = {In this study, an interval-parameter superiority–inferiority-based two-stage programming model has been developed for supporting community-scale renewable energy management ({ISITSP}-{CREM}). This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming ({ILP}), two-stage programming ({TSP}) and superiority–inferiority-based fuzzy-stochastic programming ({SI}-{FSP}). It allows uncertainties presented as both probability/possibilistic distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework, facilitating the reflection of multiple uncertainties and complexities during the process of renewable energy management systems planning. {ISITSP}-{CREM} can also be used for effectively addressing dynamic interrelationships between renewable energy availabilities, economic penalties and electricity-generation deficiencies within a community scale. Thus, complexities in renewable energy management systems can be systematically reflected, highly enhancing applicability of the modeling process. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of renewable energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different energy availabilities and economic penalties have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation plans with a minimized system cost (or economic penalties), a maximized system reliability level and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and energy security can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase potential energy generation amount, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of energy deficiency. They are helpful for supporting: (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of renewable energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy utilization, economic development and energy structure under various energy availabilities and policy interventions, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply shortage.},

	abstract = {The design of efficient energy systems, through the development of new technologies and the improvement of current ones, requires the use of rigorous process synthesis methods for generating and analysing design alternatives. We introduce a digital twin of process and energy system design that interactively translates needs and preferences of decision makers into an optimization-based model and generates meaningful solutions. The Interactive Digital Twin ({InDiT}) assists decision makers in steering the exploration of the solution space and guiding them towards relevant system design decisions, taking into account multiple aspects such as the impact of uncertainties and multi-criteria analysis. {InDiT} enhances step-by-step communication with the decision maker, relying on visual aids to keep the communication during solution generation and exploration intuitive and flexible. In this way, decision makers are guided towards relevant solutions and improve their understanding of relations between the problem definition and system design decisions, while {InDiT} builds on the decision makers’ preferences and can, after training, suggest solutions that are best-suited to their interests. The novelty of this work lies in the holistic approach of addressing both (i) the systematic generation and exploration of solutions with the assistance of a digital consultant, which translates the decision maker’s needs into machine language and vice versa, and (ii) the interactive step-by-step technique on filtering and evaluating solutions intuitively. This guarantees that the decision maker does not only get solutions based on the design specifications made, but that personal preferences are taken into account during the solution synthesis step, and that the solution space can easily be explored under different criteria. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and applied to the design case of an integrated multi-product biorefinery.},

We find a lack of consistency between the visions of nuclear power put forward by governments and industry and the experience associated with economic viability, nuclear accidents, waste handling, and so on. We use the conceptual tool of holon from complexity theory to provide a link between the models used for the governance of nuclear power and the realization of those models. The analysis of the holon over time reveals a systemic inconsistency between the way in which the story about nuclear energy is told and the experience gained after implementing nuclear energy according to the story. This inconsistency is due to the incompatible levels of observation used by different social actors endorsing different perspectives. The implementation of nuclear power has been based on the engineering view, focusing on the functioning of the nuclear power plant considered in abstraction from the wider implications of the adoption of this technology on the environment, on the economy, and on society. We cross-check this narrative with the societal metabolism view in order to provide a long term perspective of the interdependencies between nuclear power and the complex socio-economic system in which it is embedded. We conclude that the controversy over nuclear power may be treated as a problem of contrasting beliefs and normative values in clear disjunction from experience. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that more attention should be given to the quality of the narratives used in policy making.},

To ease the siting process, host compensation in exchange for permission to construct a landfill has become popular. The value and nature of host compensation varies dramatically across communities, but the reasons for this variation are relatively unexplored. We construct a national data set consisting of host fees paid by the 104 largest privately owned solid waste landfills in 1996, along with the characteristics of the landfills and the host communities. Our findings suggest that he direct participation of citizens in host fee negotiations, the community knowledge stemming from having hosted a prior landfill, and the presence of state mandates for minimum host compensation all lead to much greater amounts of host compensation. We find that the bargaining position of the landfill developer is less important, in terms of the magnitude of the effect. However we do find evidence that firms with deeper pockets are more likely to pay higher host fees. We find limited evidence that a community’s race and income level matter after accounting for factors that directly reflect citizen involvement. The analysis also indicates that landfills that accept risky wastes, such as contaminated soil or sludge, and problematic wastes, such as tires pay higher host fees.},

	abstract = {This paper approaches the choice between the open and closed nuclear fuel cycles as a matter of intergenerational justice, by revealing the value conflicts in the production of nuclear energy. The closed fuel cycle improve sustainability in terms of the supply certainty of uranium and involves less long-term radiological risks and proliferation concerns. However, it compromises short-term public health and safety and security, due to the separation of plutonium. The trade-offs in nuclear energy are reducible to a chief trade-off between the present and the future. To what extent should we take care of our produced nuclear waste and to what extent should we accept additional risks to the present generation, in order to diminish the exposure of future generation to those risks? The advocates of the open fuel cycle should explain why they are willing to transfer all the risks for a very long period of time (200,000 years) to future generations. In addition, supporters of the closed fuel cycle should underpin their acceptance of additional risks to the present generation and make the actual reduction of risk to the future plausible.},

As a result, we “willingly sleepwalk through the process of reconstituting the conditions of human existence.” Winner suggests several reasons for this somnambulism, including beliefs about the neutrality of technology and technological determinism. He is critical of each of these. Winner is also critical of the near exclusive focus of technological assessment on the positive and negative impacts or effects of a technology. Technologies certainly have impacts, but they also can restructure our physical and social worlds, and so how we live. Winner argues that this understanding of technologies as “forms of life” needs to inform our evaluations and choices regarding technological innovation and adoption.},

Most understandings of environmental justice refer to the issue of equity, or the distribution of environmental ills and benefits. But defining environmental justice as equity is incomplete, as activists, communities, and non-governmental organisations ({NGOs}) call for much more than just distribution. This essay examines how definitions beyond the distributive in these movements can help us develop conceptions of global environmental justice. The argument is that the justice demanded by global environmental justice is really threefold: equity in the distribution of environmental risk, recognition of the diversity of the participants and experiences in affected communities, and participation in the political processes which create and manage environmental policy. The existence of three different notions of justice in the movement, simultaneously, demonstrates the plausibility of a plural yet unified theory and practice of justice.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces many objective robust decision making ({MORDM}). {MORDM} combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making ({RDM}), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. Many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. {RDM} then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers' selection of promising candidate solutions. {MORDM} tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world ({SOW}). Interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their Pareto satisficing behavior in alternative {SOW}). Scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly influence the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley ({LRGV}) in Texas, {USA}. Results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. {MORDM} also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identification of triggers for adaptive management.},

In this paper, I argue, against opinions to the contrary, that Arrow’s theorem applies fully to multi-criteria decision problems as they occur in engineering design, making solution methods to such problems subject to the theorem’s negative result. Discussing the meaning and consequences for engineering design, I review the solution methods to such problems presented in the engineering design literature in the light of the theorem. It appears that underlying such methods is a mix-up of two fundamentally different problem definitions, as the theory of multi-attribute preferences, which is often presented as an adequate approach for engineering design, in fact fails to address the Arrowian multi-criteria problem. Finally, I suggest ways how engineering design might adopt results from discussions of Arrow’s theorem elsewhere in resolving its multi-criteria decision problems.},

	abstract = {End-of-life ({EOL}) solar panels may become a source of hazardous waste although there are enormous benefits globally from the growth in solar power generation. Global installed {PV} capacity reached around 400 {GW} at the end of 2017 and is expected to rise further to 4500 {GW} by 2050. Considering an average panel lifetime of 25 years, the worldwide solar {PV} waste is anticipated to reach between 4\%-14\% of total generation capacity by 2030 and rise to over 80\% (around 78 million tonnes) by 2050. Therefore, the disposal of {PV} panels will become a pertinent environmental issue in the next decades. Eventually, there will be great scopes to carefully investigate on the disposal and recycling of {PV} panels {EOL}. The {EU} has pioneered {PV} electronic waste regulations including {PV}-specific collection, recovery and recycling targets. The {EU} Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment ({WEEE}) Directive entails all producers supplying {PV} panels to the {EU} market to finance the costs of collecting and recycling {EOL} {PV} panels in Europe. Lessons can be learned from the involvement of the {EU} in forming its regulatory framework to assist other countries develop locally apposite approaches. This review focused on the current status of solar panel waste recycling, recycling technology, environmental protection, waste management, recycling policies and the economic aspects of recycling. It also provided recommendations for future improvements in technology and policy making. At present, {PV} recycling management in many countries envisages to extend the duties of the manufacturers of {PV} materials to encompass their eventual disposal or reuse. However, further improvements in the economic viability, practicality, high recovery rate and environmental performance of the {PV} industry with respect to recycling its products are indispensable.},

Though commonly viewed as a waste—with over 300,000 tons stored worldwide and an additional 7–11,000 tons accumulating annually—spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) represents a significant potential source of scarce, valuable strategic materials. Beyond the major (U and Pu) and minor (Np, Am, and Cm) actinides, which can be used to generate further energy, resources including the rare earth elements (Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, and Tb), platinum group metals, (Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag), noble gases (He, Kr, and Xe), and a range of isotopes useful for medical and energy generation purposes are also produced during fission. One reason for the accumulation of so much {SNF} is the low uptake of {SNF} recycle (or reprocessing), primarily due to the high capital and operational costs alongside concerns regarding proliferation and wastes generated. This study will highlight the predominantly overlooked potential for the recovery of strategic materials from {SNF}, which may offset costs and facilitate advanced waste management techniques for minimised waste volumes, thus increasing the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle on the path towards Net Zero. Potential challenges in the implementation of this concept will also be identified.},

Nevertheless, nuclear energy's history, including meltdowns such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, and dumping in sacred Indigenous land such as Yucca Mountain, raises important concerns in public deliberation over nuclear power. These communicative dynamics are crucial to study because they inform larger conversations in communication scholarship about the role of experts in scientific controversies and the complicated nature of public trust in and engagement with science. Thus, this study explores the perspectives of experts and how they make sense of their own communicative practices through a topical analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 nuclear scientists and engineers in the United States and Canada. Our analysis revealed four major topoi: (1) risk and safety, (2) government and policy, and (3) public education and engagement, and (4) cost, along which nuclear experts make sense of science-public boundaries and their role as scientists and scientist citizens. This paper extends our understanding and how scientists view themselves as communicative actors and the barriers and opportunities for how we can foster productive technical-public relationships around climate change solutions.},

	abstract = {Science communication has been historically predicated on the knowledge deficit model. Yet, empirical research has shown that public communication of science is more complex than what the knowledge deficit model suggests. In this essay, we pose four lines of reasoning and present empirical data for why we believe the deficit model still persists in public communication of science. First, we posit that scientists’ training results in the belief that public audiences can and do process information in a rational manner. Second, the persistence of this model may be a product of current institutional structures. Many graduate education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math ({STEM}) fields generally lack formal training in public communication. We offer empirical evidence that demonstrates that scientists who have less positive attitudes toward the social sciences are more likely to adhere to the knowledge deficit model of science communication. Third, we present empirical evidence of how scientists conceptualize “the public” and link this to attitudes toward the deficit model. We find that perceiving a knowledge deficit in the public is closely tied to scientists’ perceptions of the individuals who comprise the public. Finally, we argue that the knowledge deficit model is perpetuated because it can easily influence public policy for science issues. We propose some ways to uproot the deficit model and move toward more effective science communication efforts, which include training scientists in communication methods grounded in social science research and using approaches that engage community members around scientific issues.},

As goals for society, utopias may elicit processes of collective self-regulation, in which citizens are critical of, or take action to change, the societies they live in. In three studies, we investigated the psychological function of utopian thinking. In Study 1, measured utopianism was correlated with the activation of three utopian functions: change, critique, and compensation. In Study 2, primed utopian thinking consistently enhanced change and criticism intentions. Study 3 also provided evidence that mental contrasting—first imagining a utopian vision and then mentally contrasting the current society to this vision—underlies the facilitative effect of utopian thinking on societal engagement.},

In support of this reading, the paper explores the Wachowskis’ queer activism in favor of an extremely broad tolerance for difference (in opposition to rigid identity categories), and reads the high-concept sf premise of instantaneous empath travel and interaction with and as clustermates through Hannah Arendt’s observation that ‘we have arrived in a situation where we do not know—at least not yet—how to move politically.’ Building on that observation, Judith Butler reflects on producing a space of appearance or ‘assembly’ as grounding politics in situated social interaction, as a transition to a reconfigured (restaged, respatialized) ‘reality’ that, as Muñoz says, is not yet here.},

They co-opt the terminology of utopia to positions that are antagonistic to radical alterity. But this is not a necessary response to the utopia/pragmatism tension: Unger, who is explicitly opposed to utopia, in fact proffers a more sympathetic resolution based on the merits of vision, social improvization and collective learning.

	abstract = {Background
Transformative utopian impulse for planetary health is people's propensity to have thoughts and engage in actions of which the purpose is to transform the current society into a better one in the future by addressing existing global issues. We aimed to develop a well-validated scale that can measure the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health and uncover its role in societal transformation.
Methods
We developed a scale to measure the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health across 11 studies with 6248 participants from the {USA} (from the {MTurk} database) and the {UK} (from the Prolifico.co database). Participants were eligible take part in the studies if they completed the consent form. Participants who did not pass the seriousness check or did not accurately answer all instructed response items were excluded from statistical analyses. We used exploratory factor analyses ({EFA}) and confirmatory factor analyses ({CFA}) to determine the factor structure of the Transformative Utopian Impulse for Planetary Health Scale ({TUIPHS}). Then we analysed the {TUIPHS}’ nomological network (ie, the relationships between {TUIPHS} and various constructs ranging from personality traits and values to economic, social, and political attitudes and beliefs). We then examined the scale's incremental predictive validity by testing whether it predicts various attitudes and behaviours relevant to social change beyond scales that measure competing constructs (this part of the study is registered at {OSF} Registries [https://osf.io/ztj2f]). Finally, we examined the {TUIPHS}’ longitudinal predictive validity by probing whether it predicts people's future support for social change.
Findings
Data were collected between Oct 8, 2018, and July 6, 2020. We established that {TUIPHS} has a four-factor structure and can also be scored as a single general factor, indicating that it captures an overarching theoretical construct (ie, the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health). We then showed that the scale is related to various specific individual difference measures that capture diverse aspects of people's propensity to actively engage in thoughts and actions oriented toward the betterment of society. Moreover, {TUIPHS} predicted, above and beyond 20 competing scales highly correlated (r ≥0·50) with it, a series of 19 self-reported behavioural and attitudinal constructs pertaining to social change. Finally, participants’ past {TUIPHS} scores predicted their support, a few months later, for social movements that aim to build a more just and resilient society than in the current day.
Interpretation
This research lays the groundwork for future theoretical and empirical research into the psychological and behavioural processes attached to the transformative utopian impulse for planetary health as a source of transformative social change toward a better way of being and living.

Specifically, the paper contributes to understanding how particular ideologies of modernism and development present in territorial planning connect both countries. Taking Thomas More’s classic work ‘Utopia’ as the analytical reference, I analyze how utopian tendencies have traveled through time and space to shape territorial planning and water governance. In both countries, this was evident in the late nineteenth century through the political project to strengthen the nation state. For Spain, I describe the regenerationist movement and the hydraulic utopia led by the Spanish intellectual Joaquín Costa, who forged the dream of a water nationhood. By contrast, in Colombia, several political intellectuals looked at Europe and North America as a source of inspiration to achieve progress by controlling rivers. Through the method of disjunctive comparison, I show how the same utopian notions are expressed in similar ways in distinct contexts: violently governing the flows of rivers, standardizing minds and ordering territories towards capital growth. This paper contributes to grasping the notions and roots of the discourses that have colonized the political water agendas in both countries.},

	abstract = {Engaging non-experts in matters of science and technology has been increasingly stressed in both rhetoric and action during the past decades. Under the call for moving participation upstream, agenda setting processes have been identified as viable entry point for laypeople’s experiential and value-based knowledge into science, technology and innovation governance ({STI}). Harnessing visioning for target setting promises to elicit such knowledge, whilst at the same time evading the dilemma of informing participants about {STI} that does not exist prior to engagement. To test such claims, we investigate a large-scale citizen-visioning exercise employed as an initiation of a transdisciplinary research and innovation agenda setting process, namely {CIMULACT}. In a comparable Europe-wide process, more than 1000 laypeople (citizens) produced 179 visions of desirable futures which built the basis for co-creating future research topics for advising the {EU} research and innovation programme Horizon 2020. We provide in depth insights into the visioning methodology for inclusion of citizens into {STI} agenda setting, and discuss room for methodological improvement regarding potential loss and gains of creativity and diversity of opinions considering empirical results of ex-post participant evaluation questionnaires (n ≈ 964). The discussed data shows a generally positive evaluation of the process and engagement, since citizens are in retrospective content with the process and visions, they would participate again in a similar event, and they are in favour of the {EU} to continue hosting such events in the future. However, citizens were rather sceptic whether the results actually (can/will) have an impact on the stated aim of integration in research and innovation agenda setting.},

It is held that moralities are best understood as emerging from human culture in response to the need to promote and regulate interpersonal cooperation and internal motivational coherence in the individual. The argument ends in the conclusion that there is a bounded plurality of true and most justiﬁed moralities that accomplish these functions.

	abstract = {The autonomous vehicle ({AV}) is one of the first commercialized {AI}-embedded robots to make autonomous decisions. Despite technological advancements, unavoidable {AV} accidents that result in life-and-death consequences cannot be completely eliminated. The emerging social concern of how an {AV} should make ethical decisions during unavoidable accidents is referred to as the moral dilemma of {AV}, which has promoted heated discussions among various stakeholders. However, there are research gaps in explainable {AV} ethical decision-making processes that predict how {AVs}’ moral behaviors are made that are acceptable from the {AV} users’ perspectives. This study addresses the key question: What factors affect ethical behavioral intentions in the {AV} moral dilemma? To answer this question, this study draws theories from multidisciplinary research fields to propose the “Integrative ethical decision-making framework for the {AV} moral dilemma.” The framework includes four interdependent ethical decision-making stages: {AV} moral dilemma issue framing, intuitive moral reasoning, rational moral reasoning, and ethical behavioral intention making. Further, the framework includes variables (e.g., perceived moral intensity, individual factors, and personal moral philosophies) that influence the ethical decision-making process. For instance, the framework explains that {AV} users from Eastern cultures will tend to endorse a situationist ethics position (high idealism and high relativism), which views that ethical decisions are relative to context, compared to {AV} users from Western cultures. This proposition is derived from the link between individual factors and personal moral philosophy. Moreover, the framework proposes a dual-process theory, which explains that both intuitive and rational moral reasoning are integral processes of ethical decision-making during the {AV} moral dilemma. Further, this framework describes that ethical behavioral intentions that lead to decisions in the {AV} moral dilemma are not fixed, but are based on how an individual perceives the seriousness of the situation, which is shaped by their personal moral philosophy. This framework provides a step-by-step explanation of how pluralistic ethical decision-making occurs, reducing the abstractness of {AV} moral reasoning processes.},

	abstract = {Utilitarian versus deontological inclinations have been studied extensively in the field of moral psychology. However, the field has been lacking a thorough psychometric evaluation of the most commonly used measures. In this paper, we examine the factorial structure of an often used set of 12 moral dilemmas purportedly measuring utilitarian/deontological moral inclinations. We ran three different studies (and a pilot) to investigate the issue. In Study 1, we used standard Exploratory Factor Analysis and Schmid-Leimann (g factor) analysis; results of which informed the a priori single-factor model for our second study. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis in Study 2 were replicated in Study 3. Finally, we ran a weak invariance analysis between the models of Study 2 and 3, concluding that there is no significant difference between factor loading in these studies. We find reason to support a single-factor model of utilitarian/deontological inclinations. In addition, certain dilemmas have consistent error covariance, suggesting that this should be taken into consideration in future studies. In conclusion, three studies, pilot and an invariance analysis, systematically suggest the following. (1) No item needs to be dropped from the scale. (2) There is a unidimensional structure for utilitarian/deontological preferences behind the most often used dilemmas in moral psychology, suggesting a single latent cognitive mechanism. (3) The most common set of dilemmas in moral psychology can be successfully used as a unidimensional measure of utilitarian/deontological moral inclinations, but would benefit from using weighted averages over simple averages. (4) Consideration should be given to dilemmas describing infants.},

Many of those promoting relational approaches have rejected the standard legal approaches and preferred instead to promote alternatives based on an ethic of care. The article explores the capacity of both rights and best interests in the context of medical law to take account of relational values. It accepts that both approaches raise concerns for relational ethicists, but both have the potential to develop promising line of argument. It seeks to analyse and explore them.},

	shorttitle = {Algorithmic injustice},
	abstract = {It has become trivial to point out that algorithmic systems increasingly pervade the social sphere. Improved efficiency—the hallmark of these systems—drives their mass integration into day-to-day life. However, as a robust body of research in the area of algorithmic injustice shows, algorithmic systems, especially when used to sort and predict social outcomes, are not only inadequate but also perpetuate harm. In particular, a persistent and recurrent trend within the literature indicates that society's most vulnerable are disproportionally impacted. When algorithmic injustice and harm are brought to the fore, most of the solutions on offer (1) revolve around technical solutions and (2) do not center disproportionally impacted communities. This paper proposes a fundamental shift—from rational to relational—in thinking about personhood, data, justice, and everything in between, and places ethics as something that goes above and beyond technical solutions. Outlining the idea of ethics built on the foundations of relationality, this paper calls for a rethinking of justice and ethics as a set of broad, contingent, and fluid concepts and down-to-earth practices that are best viewed as a habit and not a mere methodology for data science. As such, this paper mainly offers critical examinations and reflection and not “solutions.”},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Background: Answering the question “what is the right thing to do?” is, for most nurses and other healthcare professionals, an ethical question. Many decisions in healthcare are based on determining whether or not an action, or intervention, is to be taken. When a framework is used to help guide these decisions patient care can be improved. Relational ethics is an ethical framework that has been developed by an interdisciplinary team to help healthcare professionals answer ethical questions within complex environments. When applying this action ethic framework health professionals are guided to create the moral space where responsiveness and responsibility for yourself and the other is enacted and ethical questions answered. Aims: The purpose of this article is to discuss and describe the core elements of Relational Ethics and to demonstrate how a relational ethics framework can be used to facilitate ethical healthcare decision-making.
Method: A clinical exemplar, drawn from a mental health nursing setting, is used to demonstrate how a relational ethic framework can be applied within a clinical healthcare context.
Results: Through the use of a relational ethics framework the essential core elements of Relational Ethics are applied which resulted in ethically reflective healthcare decision-making.
Conclusions: Clinicians are able to directly apply an ethical framework to their healthcare practice. Additionally, Relational Ethics is a promising action ethic which can be used to create the moral space needed to enact ethical decision-making.},

Ubuntu  has been proposed as a useful alternative to current (Western) ethical frameworks for evaluating global bioethical issues, contributing theoretical diversity to the clinical context. However, the literature regarding this philosophy is often described as confusing, and is characterised by a number of competing interpretations.    Objective.  To arrive, by way of a systematic review, at a definition of  ubuntu  that encompasses the common themes that appear in competing interpretations.    Methods.  Searches were done in {PhilPaper}, {PubMed} and Google Scholar using a variety of search strings, generating 1 207 hits. After screening for English language, as well as relevance of the article after reading the title, abstract and full text, 99 articles were included for review. Another 17 articles were identified through snowballing and additional searches, giving a total of 116 articles that were included in the review.    Results.  This review shows that  ubuntu  is an essentially relational ethics, which prizes relationships of interdependence, fellowship, reconciliation, relationality, community friendliness, harmonious relationships and other-regarding actions such as compassion and actions that are likely to be good for others, in which actions are morally right to the extent that they honour the capacity to relate communally, reduce discord or promote friendly relationships with others, and in which the physical world and the spiritual world are fundamentally united.    Conclusion.  Scholars, health professionals, policy makers and others should be aware that an alternative ethical theory exists in the global South that may be applied to address a variety of global (bio)ethical issues. Further research, however, is needed to evaluate how properly action-guiding this formulation is in particular contexts.},

	abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence ({AI}) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency in the delivery of care. However, the design, deployment and use of {AI} in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that {AI} systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in {AI} for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of {AI} for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of “I am because we are” in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive {AI} systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all. Highlighting the relational aspect of Ubuntu, this paper not only calls for rethinking {AI} ethics in healthcare but also endorses discussions about the need for non-Western ethical approaches to be utilised in {AI} ethics more broadly.},

An anthropology of the social contract explores ethnographically how this pervasive concept, laden with assumptions about human nature, political organisation, government, and notions such as freedom, consensus and legitimacy, impacts state–society relations in different settings.

	shorttitle = {The social contract as a tool of analysis},
	abstract = {The term “social contract” is increasingly used in social science literature to describe sets of state-society relations – in particular with reference to the Middle East and North Africa ({MENA}). Nevertheless, the term has thus far remained insufficiently conceptualized and its potential to inform a systematic analysis of contemporary states has been underutilized. This article contributes to the filling of this gap. It defines social contracts as sets of formal and informal agreements between societal groups and their sovereign (government or other actor in power) on rights and obligations toward each other. We argue that social contracts are partly informal institutions, which are meant to make state-society interactions more predictable and thereby politics more stable. Their effectiveness depends on their substance (deliverables exchanged between government and society), scope (the actors involved and the geographic range of influence) and temporal dimension (beginning, evolution, and duration). Social contracts can differ substantially in all three dimensions. This approach complements established theories of comparative politics and sharpens the perspective on state-society relations. It helps to (i) compare state-society relations in different countries, (ii) track changes within one country, (iii) find out when and why social contracts are broken or even revoked, (iv) uncover how external players affect state-society relations, and (v) analyze how state-society relations can be Pareto improved. Against this background, this article shows that after independence, {MENA} countries had quite similar social contracts, which were based on the provision of social benefits rather than political participation. We argue that they degenerated steadily after 1985 due to increasing populations and budgetary problems. The Arab uprisings in 2010–11 were an expression of discontent with a situation in which governments provided neither political participation nor social benefits, like employment. Since then, social contracts in {MENA} countries have developed in different directions, and their long-term stability is questionable. We address the question of how they can be transformed to become more inclusive and therefore more stable.},

In order for laws and policies to be implemented in a manner consistent with liberal and republican principles, an alternative public ethics is proposed—a public ethics of care.

Juxtaposed with engineers’ everyday ethical decision-making practices, professional ethics approaches are shown to be based in deontological and virtue ethics, narrowly focused on the individual engineer as a professional, and thus inappropriate and insufficient for the very practical field of engineering. The author argues for an alternative direction toward a situated pragmatic and social ethics in engineering that disrupts the current social arrangement around robot development through ethnographic intervention in the engineers’ negotiation of values in the design process.},

	abstract = {We examine the thermodynamic evolution of various evolving systems, from primitive physical systems to complex living systems, and conclude that they involve similar processes which are phenomenological manifestations of the second law of thermodynamics. We take the reformulated second law of thermodynamics of Hatsopoulos and Keenan and Kestin and extend it to nonequilibrium regions, where nonequilibrium is described in terms of gradients maintaining systems at some distance away from equilibrium. The reformulated second law suggests that as systems are moved away from equilibrium they will take advantage of all available means to resist externally applied gradients. When highly ordered complex systems emerge, they develop and grow at the expense of increasing the disorder at higher levels in the system's hierarchy. We note that this behaviour appears universally in physical and chemical systems. We present a paradigm which provides for a thermodynamically consistent explanation of why there is life, including the origin of life, biological growth, the development of ecosystems, and patterns of biological evolution observed in the fossil record. We illustrate the use of this paradigm through a discussion of ecosystem development. We argue that as ecosystems grow and develop, they should increase their total dissipation, develop more complex structures with more energy flow, increase their cycling activity, develop greater diversity and generate more hierarchical levels, all to abet energy degradation. Species which survive in ecosystems are those that funnel energy into their own production and reproduction and contribute to autocatalytic processes which increase the total dissipation of the ecosystem. In short, ecosystems develop in ways which systematically increase their ability to degrade the incoming solar energy. We believe that our thermodynamic paradigm makes it possible for the study of ecosystems to be developed from a descriptive science to predictive science founded on the most basic principle of physics.},

This marginalization of care work, however, is ethically suspect, and as such I argue here that we should use the feminist ethics of care as a way to analyze current policy and guide the creation of future policy to ensure more ethically robust policy statements. I advocate for the use of care ethics in addition to human rights ethically guided public policy, which prioritizes the effort to implement human rights standards through government action. My claim is that human rights should not be our sole basis for moral and political reasoning, especially in the policy process. Policy shapes our lives, and how we live in relation to particular others. Care ethics can and should be used as an ethical guide for the policy process because it can bring to the fore how institutional patterns of power shape our relations, an analysis that human rights theories are not, in general, built to undertake.},

We attempt to use ubuntu to countermand the current dominant social paradigm ({DSP}) of hatred, intolerance, abuse of human rights, dehumanization, exploitation, authoritarianism, poverty, and oppression that plague the human race at the national and international levels. This work proposes a conception of ubuntu as a value system built upon the application of some key moral and democratic values for liberation and transformation. Specifically, ubuntu ethics is defined as a set of values central among which are reciprocity, common good, peaceful relations, emphasis on human dignity, and the value of human life as well as consensus, tolerance, and mutual respect. These features are to operate at the national level. We also argue for a possibility utilizing ubuntu ethical correlates as materials for establishing stable and viable human relations within the international system or global order. Our aim is to conceptualize ubuntu as an ethical idea and praxis, as well as to situate it as an ethical ideal all with a view to making humans better and thus tackling in a systematic manner, our natural and man-made existential predicaments.},

Although such programs increase the technical capacity of a state to build nuclear weapons, they have important countervailing political effects that limit the odds of proliferation. Specifically, nuclear energy programs increase the likelihood that parallel nuclear weapons programs will be detected and face counterproliferation pressures; they also increase the costliness of nonproliferation sanctions. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, states with nuclear energy programs historically have not been significantly more likely to seek or acquire nuclear weapons.

the plausibility of the countervailing political effects of nuclear energy programs.},

	abstract = {Horizontal nuclear proliferation presents what is sometimes referred to as the “Nth country problem,” or identifying which state could be next to acquire nuclear weapons. Nuclear fuel cycle technologies can contribute to both nuclear power generation and weapons development. Consequently, observers often view civilian nuclear programs with suspicion even as research on nuclear latency and the technological inputs of proliferation has added nuance to these discussions. To contribute to this debate, I put forth a simple theoretical proposition: En route to developing a civilian nuclear infrastructure and mastering the fuel cycle, states pass through a proliferation “danger zone.” States with fuel cycle capabilities below a certain threshold will likely be unable to proliferate. States that pass through the “danger zone” without proliferating will be unlikely to do so in the future. I support this proposition by introducing preliminary analysis from the Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) Index, a new heuristic tool to complement political assessments of the connection between civilian nuclear energy development and nuclear weapons proliferation. I conclude with policy implications for contemporary Iran, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and South Korea. Taken together, this article calls for increased policymaker interaction with historical cases and more sophisticated academic engagement with the nuclear fuel cycle.},

Here, we address this question from an ethical perspective, evaluating different strategies of energy system development in terms of three ethical criteria, which will differentially appeal to proponents of different normative ethical frameworks. Starting from a standard analysis of climate change as arising from an intergenerational collective action problem, we evaluate whether contributions from nuclear energy will, on expectation, increase the likelihood of successfully phasing out fossil fuels in time to avert dangerous global warming. For many socio-economic and geographic contexts, our review of the energy system modeling literature suggests the answer to this question is “yes.” We conclude that, from the point of view of climate change mitigation, investments in nuclear energy as part of a broader energy portfolio will be ethically required to minimize the risks of decarbonization failure, and thus the tail risks of catastrophic global warming. Finally, using a sensitivity analysis, we consider which other aspects of nuclear energy deployment, apart from climate change, have the potential to overturn the ultimate ethical verdict on investments in nuclear energy. Out of several potential considerations (e.g., nuclear waste, accidents, safety), we suggest that its potential interplay — whether beneficial or adverse — with the proliferation of nuclear weapons is the most plausible candidate.},

Many of these mines were abandoned and have not been reclaimed. Native Americans in the Colorado Plateau area including the Navajo, Southern Ute, Ute Mountain, Hopi, Zuni, Laguna, Acoma, and several other Pueblo nations, with their intimate knowledge of the land, often led miners to uranium resources during this exploration boom.

	abstract = {Tailings dam failures have received significant attention in recent years due to the catastrophic downstream consequences, as evidenced by the 2019 Feijão disaster in Brazil and numerous precedents. This paper presents a timely review of tailings flows with the support of a comprehensive global database of 63 cases that have been remotely analyzed through a compilation of satellite imagery, digital elevation models and literature. The synthesis provides insight into the influence of impoundment conditions, preconditioning and trigger variables, failure mechanisms and the downstream environment on tailings flow behaviour. The database also sheds light on the limitations of data quality and availability in the public domain. Magnitude-frequency statistics indicate that tailings dam breaches that have produced catastrophic mass flows with total outflow volumes of ≥1 M m3 have occurred at a mean recurrence interval of 2–3 years over the period 1965–2020. Weather hazards and impoundment drainage issues are identified as major causative variables. The occurrence of liquefaction and/or the incorporation of free water are sufficient conditions to trigger extremely rapid, highly mobile behaviour. Travel path confinement and steeper bed slopes enhance flow velocities (peak of 25–30 m/s) and kinetic energy, whereas flow mobility appears to be exacerbated along major rivers. Although general trends may be observed in empirical observations, such efforts are prone to substantial uncertainty due to the complexity and variability of site conditions (that are typically unaccounted for in broad statistical approaches) as well as poor data availability and/or quality for many of the selected cases. This highlights the importance of performing site-specific investigations through numerical models, laboratory tests and field observations to better predict post-breach behaviour (ideally within a probabilistic framework) when undertaking site assessments.},

	abstract = {This study assesses the risk of energy accidents—their frequency over time, severity in terms of fatalities, and scope in terms of property damage—among a suite of low-carbon energy systems. Using an original historical database of energy accidents over the period 1950–2014, it comparatively assesses energy accident risk across biofuels, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectricity, hydrogen, nuclear power, solar energy, and wind energy. Our study shows how these energy systems collectively involved 686 accidents resulting in 182,794 human fatalities and \$265.1 billion in property damages. Across the entire sample, the mean amount of property damage was \$388.8 million and 267.2 fatalities per accident, though when reflected as a median the numbers substantially improve to \$820,000 in damages per accident and zero fatalities. Wind energy is the most frequent to incur an accident within our sample (48.8 percent of accidents), hydroelectric accidents tend to be the most fatal (97.2 percent of all deaths), and nuclear energy accidents tend to be the most expensive (accounting for 90.8 percent of damages). The article uses this data to present a set of unique risk profiles: nuclear, hydro, and wind energy are categorized as having a “high” risk of accidents; hydrogen, biofuels, and biomass “moderate” a accident risk; solar and geothermal a “low” risk.},

	abstract = {Energy justice is often approached through the four tenets of procedural, distributive, restorative and recognition justice. Though these tenets are important placeholders for addressing what type of justice issues are involved, they require further normative substantiations. These are achieved by using principles of justice to specify why – normatively speaking – something is just or unjust within each category or tenet of justice. In addressing the principles of justice, it is important to acknowledge normative uncertainties, or the fact that different (incompatible) conceptions of justice might be morally defensible, leading to different normative conclusions or policy recommendations. This paper reviews the definitions of tenets in energy justice scholarship, the occurrence of normative claims, and how these claims are justified. The review shows that the scholarship ignores to a large extent normative uncertainties. In response, we propose a revisited energy justice framework, focusing on four aspects that help us to articulate the normative uncertainties in both the principles and the tenets of energy justice. These aspects are (i) the scale of justice (i.e. whether justice is considered at a local, national, regional, multinational or global scale), (ii) the subject of justice, (iii) the body of knowledge that is assumed and (iv) the time frame in which justice issues are being considered. We hope to provide a conceptual framework that make explicit the different types of normative assumptions underlying claims of justice, which will ultimately improve the quality and legitimacy of normative conclusions such as policy recommendations that follow.},

The research aims to address the dual challenge of defining local ownership and participation and exploring case-specific applications of these concepts. To achieve this, the study employs the Socio-Ecological Systems Framework and literature on participation, providing a theoretical foundation for analyzing citizen engagement. A mixed-methods approach, including interviews and data collection, is used to examine five Dutch community heating initiatives. The analysis highlights the importance of an enabling participatory environment, inclusive participation, information sharing, and the presence of energy cooperatives for successful citizen engagement. The findings have practical implications for {EU} energy policy, emphasizing the need for clear definitions, inclusive decision-making processes, and tailored engagement strategies.},

	abstract = {Final disposal of spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) from nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) is an ethical issue with implications within and across generations. We address this issue from the perspective of nuclear communities that host nuclear waste disposal sites. These are primarily the communities that face injustice due to the potential radiological risks. A resident survey (n = 454) was conducted in two Finnish nuclear communities, i.e. Eurajoki and Pyhäjoki, that are being considered as alternative sites for a second repository for {SNF}. The nuclear waste management ({NWM}) company Posiva is already building a repository in Eurajoki, the first in Finland. These communities are in different stages of their lifecycles as nuclear communities. We investigated the residents’ conceptions of justice and trust regarding the repository {SNF} management and its main actors, and how these conceptions related to acceptance of the repository. The main findings show that residents of both communities perceived intragenerational and intergenerational injustices to be important in the procedures and the distribution of risks and benefits of the proposed repository. Claims regarding justice and trust were related to the acceptance of the repository. The community with the longer history with {NWM} expressed greater mistrust and perceived greater procedural injustice than the community with less earlier experience, which – in turn – expressed more concern over intragenerational distributive justice than the former community. Moreover, having longer history with {NWM} did not lead to a different understanding regarding responsibility toward future generations as resident’s in both communities expressed similar concern over intergenerational justice. Moreover, having more experience of {NWM} did not enhance local acceptance. We emphasize that these results should be understood in the light of the prevailing situation in Finland, where the planning of the second repository is at a very early stage.},

Given the long-term risks of nuclear energy, intergenerational justice should be explicitly included in such an analysis. This will also have implications for nuclear power policies. Furthermore, emotions such as sympathy and feelings of responsibility can provide moral insights; they should be taken seriously in the debate about nuclear energy rather than being dismissed as irrational distractions as is currently the case.

We show this by an analysis of how technology can contribute to the solution of so-called moral overload or moral dilemmas. Such dilemmas typically create a moral residue that is the basis of a second-order principle that tells us to reshape the world so that we can meet all our moral obligations.

I will argue that these assumptions are theoretically problematic and empirically questionable. We should realize that both cases, ozone and climate, are profoundly different and only have superficial similarities. Ozone science developed late, but efforts to protect the ozone layer happened swiftly. The relation between carbon dioxide and climate change has been studied for many decades, but efforts to control global warming have failed so far.

We create a variant of the Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy ({RICE})—a regionally disaggregated version of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy ({DICE})—in which we introduce a more fine-grained representation of economic inequalities within the model’s regions. This allows us to model the common observation that climate change impacts are not evenly distributed within regions and that poorer people are more vulnerable than the rest of the population. Our results suggest that this is important to the social cost of carbon—as significant, potentially, for the optimal carbon price as the debate between Stern and Nordhaus on discounting.},

	abstract = {Household consumption carbon footprint and inequality reductions are vital for a sustainable society, especially for rural areas. This study, focusing on rural China, one of the fastest growing economies with a massive population, explored the carbon footprint and inequality of household consumption using the latest micro household survey data of 2018 linked to environmental extended input–-output analysis. The results show that in 2018 in rural China, the average household carbon footprint is 2.46 tons {CO}2-eq per capita, which is around one-third of China’s average footprint, indicating the large potential for further growth. Housing (45.32\%), transportation (20.45\%), and food (19.62\%) are the dominant contributors to the carbon footprint. Meanwhile, great inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 0.488, among rural households is observed, which is largely due to differences in type of house built or purchased (explaining 24.44\% of the variation), heating (18.10\%), car purchase (12.44\%), and petrol consumption (12.44\%). Provinces, average education, and nonfarm income are among the important factors influencing the inequality. In the process of urbanization and rural revitalization, there is a high possibility that the household carbon footprint continues to increase, maintaining high levels of inequality. The current energy transition toward less carbon-intensive fuels in rural China is likely to dampen the growth rates of carbon footprints and potentially decrease inequality. Carbon intensity decrease could significantly reduce carbon footprints, but increase inequality. More comprehensive measures to reduce carbon footprint and inequality are needed, including transitioning to clean energy, poverty alleviation, reduction of income inequality, and better health care coverage.},

During the winter storm that brought historically low temperatures, snow, and ice to the entire state of Texas in February 2021, Texas power-generating plant operators resorted to rolling blackouts to prevent collapse of the power grid when power demand overwhelmed supply. To reveal the disparate impact of managed power outages on vulnerable subpopulations in Harris County, Texas, which encompasses the city of Houston, we collected and analyzed community-scale big data using statistical and trend classification analyses. The results highlight the spatial and temporal patterns of impacts on vulnerable subpopulations in Harris County. The findings show a significant disparity in the extent and duration of power outages experienced by low-income and minority groups, suggesting the existence of inequality in the management and implementation of the power outage. Also, the extent of burst pipes and disrupted food access, as a proxy for storm impact, were more severe for low-income and minority groups. Insights provided by the results could form a basis from which infrastructure operators might enhance social equality during managed service disruptions in such events. The results and findings demonstrate the value of community-scale big data sources for rapid impact assessment in the aftermath of extreme weather events.},

	abstract = {The consumption and emissions of hydrofluorocarbons ({HFCs}) are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades in response to regulation of ozone depleting gases under the Montreal Protocol. The projected increases result primarily from sustained growth in demand for refrigeration, air-conditioning ({AC}) and insulating foam products in developing countries assuming no new regulation of {HFC} consumption or emissions. New {HFC} scenarios are presented based on current hydrochlorofluorocarbon ({HCFC}) consumption in leading applications, patterns of replacements of {HCFCs} by {HFCs} in developed countries, and gross domestic product ({GDP}) growth. Global {HFC} emissions significantly exceed previous estimates after 2025 with developing country emissions as much as 800\% greater than in developed countries in 2050. Global {HFC} emissions in 2050 are equivalent to 9–19\% ({CO}2-eq. basis) of projected global {CO}2 emissions in business-as-usual scenarios and contribute a radiative forcing equivalent to that from 6–13 years of {CO}2 emissions near 2050. This percentage increases to 28–45\% compared with projected {CO}2 emissions in a 450-ppm {CO}2 stabilization scenario. In a hypothetical scenario based on a global cap followed by 4\% annual reductions in consumption, {HFC} radiative forcing is shown to peak and begin to decline before 2050.},

The first of these problems is the greedy permutation (or farthest-first traversal) of a finite metric space: a permutation of the points of the space in which each point is as far as possible from all previous points. We describe randomized algorithms to compute \$(1+{\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$-approximate greedy permutations of any graph with \$n\$ vertices and \$m\$ edges in expected time \$O{\textbackslash}bigl({\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(m+n){\textbackslash}log n{\textbackslash}log(n/{\textbackslash}varepsilon) {\textbackslash}bigr)\$. We also present an algorithm that computes a \$(1+{\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$-approximate greedy permutations of points in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in expected time \$O({\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} n{\textasciicircum}\{1+1/(1+{\textbackslash}varepsilon){\textasciicircum}2 + o(1)\})\$. Additionally we describe a deterministic algorithm to find exact greedy permutations of any graph with \$n\$ vertices and treewidth \$O(1)\$ in worst-case time \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}{\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}\{O(1)\} n)\$.The second problem we consider is distance selection: given \$k {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}binom\{n\}\{2\}\$, we are interested in computing the \$k\$th smallest distance in the given metric space. We show that for planar graph metrics one can approximate this distance, up to a constant factor, in near linear time.},

We define normative uncertainties as situations where there are different partially morally defensible – but incompatible – options or courses of action, or ones in which there is no fully morally defensible option. We conceptualize normative uncertainties, distinguishing between the four categories of evolutionary, theoretical, conceptual, and epistemic normative uncertainties. We will show different instances of normative uncertainties in climate adaptation strategies. We finally present two methods for identifying and dealing with normative uncertainties, namely, the Wide Reflective Equilibrium and adaptive planning. Situations of normative uncertainties have always been and will continue to be present in risk decisions and they have often been dealt with in an implicit manner. In this article, we make them explicit, which could lead to better morally informed and justified decisions about climate risks.

By solely focusing on social acceptance, we could, however, overlook important ethical aspects of technological risk, particularly when we evaluate technologies with transnational and intergenerational risks. I argue that good governance of risky technology requires analyzing both social acceptance and ethical acceptability. Conceptually, these two notions are mostly complementary. Social acceptance studies are not capable of sufficiently capturing all the morally relevant features of risky technologies; ethical analyses do not typically include stakeholders’ opinions, and they therefore lack the relevant empirical input for a thorough ethical evaluation. Only when carried out in conjunction are these two types of analysis relevant to national and international governance of risky technology. I discuss the Rawlsian wide reflective equilibrium as a method for marrying social acceptance and ethical acceptability. Although the rationale of my argument is broadly applicable, I will examine the case of multinational nuclear waste repositories in particular. This example will show how ethical issues may be overlooked if we focus only on social acceptance, and will provide a test case for demonstrating how the wide reflective equilibrium can help to bridge the proverbial acceptance-acceptability gap.},

Those two contradictory indicators are incorporated in a multi-criteria optimisation leading to iterations of two scenario: business as usual and 2 °C climate policy. The results present the evolution of the climate change emission versus the operational costs of the power system up to 2050. The yearly electricity mix evaluations allow assessing the long-term development of the European energy system, where a focus is done on variable renewable energy production. It is shown that policy-only solutions, associated with a traditional cost-oriented optimisation, have a limited impact on helping the power sector to reach emission levels targets. Integrating the objective of reducing emissions to the management of power plants would reduce the absolute and cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The counterpart is that the system electricity price tends to increase faster thus implying increased social costs.},

Research prioritization is critical to expedite the development and deployment of such technologies across their vast system space (e.g., technology choices, design and operating decisions). In this study, we introduce {QSDsan} – an open-source tool in Python for the quantitative sustainable design ({QSD}) of sanitation and resource recovery systems. As an integrated platform for system design, simulation, techno-economic analysis ({TEA}), and life cycle assessment ({LCA}), {QSDsan} can be used to enumerate and investigate the expansive landscape of technologies under uncertainty, while considering contextual parameters that are critical to technology deployment. We illustrate the core capabilities of {QSDsan} through two distinct examples: (i) evaluation of a complete sanitation value chain that compares three alternative systems; and (ii) dynamic process modeling of the wastewater treatment plant described in the benchmark simulation model no. 1 ({BSM}1). Through these examples, we show the utility of {QSDsan} to automate design, enable flexible process modeling, achieve rapid and reproducible simulations, and to perform advanced statistical analyses with integrated visualization. We strive to make {QSDsan} a community-led platform with online documentation, tutorials (explanatory notes, executable scripts, and video demonstrations), and a growing ecosystem of supporting packages (e.g., {DMsan} for decision-making). This platform can be freely accessed, used, and expanded by researchers, practitioners, and the public alike, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safe and affordable sanitation technologies around the globe.},

	abstract = {In resource-limited settings, conventional sanitation systems often fail to meet their goals─with system failures stemming from a mismatch among community needs, constraints, and deployed technologies. Although decision-making tools exist to help assess the appropriateness of conventional sanitation systems in a specific context, there is a lack of a holistic decision-making framework to guide sanitation research, development, and deployment ({RD}\&D) of technologies. In this study, we introduce {DMsan}─an open-source multi-criteria decision analysis Python package that enables users to transparently compare sanitation and resource recovery alternatives and characterize the opportunity space for early-stage technologies. Informed by the methodological choices frequently used in literature, the core structure of {DMsan} includes five criteria (technical, resource recovery, economic, environmental, and social), 28 indicators, criteria weight scenarios, and indicator weight scenarios tailored to 250 countries/territories, all of which can be adapted by end-users. {DMsan} integrates with the open-source Python package {QSDsan} (quantitative sustainable design for sanitation and resource recovery systems) for system design and simulation to calculate quantitative economic (via techno-economic analysis), environmental (via life cycle assessment), and resource recovery indicators under uncertainty. Here, we illustrate the core capabilities of {DMsan} using an existing, conventional sanitation system and two proposed alternative systems for Bwaise, an informal settlement in Kampala, Uganda. The two example use cases are (i) use by implementation decision makers to enhance decision-making transparency and understand the robustness of sanitation choices given uncertain and/or varying stakeholder input and technology ability and (ii) use by technology developers seeking to identify and expand the opportunity space for their technologies. Through these examples, we demonstrate the utility of {DMsan} to evaluate sanitation and resource recovery systems tailored to individual contexts and increase transparency in technology evaluations, {RD}\&D prioritization, and context-specific decision making.},

The attention on persistent homology is constantly growing in a large number of application domains, such as biology and chemistry, astrophysics, automatic classiﬁcation of images, sensor and social network analysis. Thus, an increasing number of researchers is now approaching to persistent homology as a tool to be used in their research activity. At the same time, the literature lacks of tools for introducing beginners to this topic, especially if they do not have a strong mathematical background in algebraic topology. We propose here two complementary tools which meet this requirement. The ﬁrst one is a web-based user-guide equipped with interactive examples to facilitate the comprehension of the notions at the basis of persistent homology. The second one is an interactive tool, with a speciﬁc focus on shape analysis, developed for studying persistence pairs by visualizing them directly on the input complex.},

We update previous efforts to quantify the scientific consensus on climate change by searching the recent literature for papers sceptical of anthropogenic-caused global warming. From a dataset of 88125 climate-related papers published since 2012, when this question was last addressed comprehensively, we examine a randomized subset of 3000 such publications. We also use a second sample-weighted approach that was specifically biased with keywords to help identify any sceptical peer-reviewed papers in the whole dataset. We identify four sceptical papers out of the sub-set of 3000, as evidenced by abstracts that were rated as implicitly or explicitly sceptical of human-caused global warming. In our sample utilizing pre-identified sceptical keywords we found 28 papers that were implicitly or explicitly sceptical. We conclude with high statistical confidence that the scientific consensus on human-caused contemporary climate change—expressed as a proportion of the total publications—exceeds 99\% in the peer reviewed scientific literature.},

In the chapter, the successes and drawbacks of this approach are pointed out and some ideas are presented for producing more scientifically sound scenarios. The qualitative storylines provide an understandable vehicle for communicating the messages of the scenarios and can express the more complex dimensions and interconnectedness of environmental problems. The quantitative scenarios provide a consistency check to the different assumptions of the qualitative scenarios and the numerical data often needed in environmental studies. To capitalize on their advantages, qualitative and quantitative scenarios have been combined in recent international scenario exercises.},

Nevertheless, planning wind power developments appears to be a complicated matter in most countries. The problems that have to be dealt with during decision making processes on the siting of wind turbines are usually referred to as mere ‘communication problems’. However, public attitudes towards wind power are fundamentally different from attitudes towards wind farms. This ‘gap’ causes misunderstandings about the nature of public support for renewables. In particular where planners easily assume support for renewables can be generated by information campaigns emphasising the environmental benefits, whereas opposition to renewable energy schemes can be explained by a selfish ‘not in my backyard’ attitude. Both explanations used by planners, authorities and, unfortunately, by many scholars, are falsified. Furthermore, policies that still take this ‘common knowledge’ for granted can have negative consequences for the implementation rates of renewables. Visual evaluation of the impact of wind power on landscape values is by far the dominant factor in explaining why some are opposed to wind power and others are supporting it. Moreover, feelings about equity and fairness appear the determinants of ‘backyard’ motives, instead of selfishness.},

(4) The reason for understanding opposition is to overcome it. (5) Trust is key. The paper calls for critical reflection on each of these assumptions. It should not be assumed that opposition to wind power is deviant/illegitimate. Opposition cannot be dismissed as ignorant or misinformed instead it must be acknowledged that objectors are often very knowledgeable. Public attitudes and responses to wind power should not be examined in order to mitigate potential future opposition, but rather in order to understand the social context of renewable energy. Trust is identified as a key issue, however greater trust must be placed in members of the public and in their knowledge.

Developing earlier work, the paper proposes a more comprehensive heuristic framework, accommodating a wide range of different disciplinary and socio-political perspectives.

Recent years have seen a growth in scenarios for assessing the implications of low carbon futures, but relatively little work has linked these energy scenarios to the broader literature on scenario development. This paper undertakes a methodological review of a selection of {UK} and international low carbon scenario studies, using a typology of ‘trend based’, ‘technical feasibility’ and ‘modelling’ studies. Dominant methodologies in such studies have been the 2×2 axis and the ‘back-casting’ approach. Strengths of the studies reviewed include technological detail, and identification of key economic and social constraints. Weaknesses include the over-reliance on constructs such as exogenous emissions constraints, and high level trends, which diminish the ability to understand how the various future scenarios could be brought about or avoided. This is compounded by the lack of depiction of specific system actors; the tendency to abstract policy from the scenarios; and the resulting failure to consider policy, technology and behaviour in an iterative, ‘co-evolving’ fashion.},

Consequences of the recent energy policies and strategies are already being felt in, developed countries’ power systems, with the integration of rising quotas in renewable, energy technologies. However, while the tools that aid decision making on power, planning show that economic and environmental issues are easily quantifiable and thus, modeled, social concerns have been addressed in a less extensive and more, subjective way, implying in most cases expert participation on multi-criteria decision aid, techniques. A survey of recent papers providing public perceptions on electricity, generation technologies and projects is presented. These papers were chosen and, reviewed in order to present a representative array of methodologies that are used to, assess social acceptance of technologies. According to some of the reviewed papers, this issue is suggested to be fundamental to increase project success. As a conclusion, stands the fact that further discussion is still needed in order to achieve solid, agreement, among experts, over what are the positive and the negative drivers to, social sustainability; otherwise models will not be able to translate reality and improve it, under this point of view.},

	abstract = {Decisions concerning the siting of infrastructure developments or the use of natural resources have the potential to damage a community's social well-being if the outcomes are perceived to be unfair. Justice is accepted as central to the well functioning of society with fairness being an expectation in day-to-day interactions. Outcomes that are perceived to be unfair can result in protests, damaged relationships and divided communities particularly when decisions are made which benefit some sections of the community at the perceived expense of others. Through empirical research using a wind farm pilot study, community perceptions of a community consultation process are explored using procedural justice principles to evaluate fairness. Findings from the pilot study indicate that perceptions of fairness do influence how people perceive the legitimacy of the outcome, and that a fairer process will increase acceptance of the outcome. A key research finding was that different sections of a community are likely to be influenced by different aspects of justice, namely by outcome fairness, outcome favourability and process fairness. Based on this finding, a community fairness framework was developed which has potential application in community consultation to increase social acceptance of the outcome.},

	abstract = {The majority of global emissions scenarios compatible with holding global warming to less than 2 °C depend on the large-scale use of Greenhouse Gas Removal ({GGR}) technologies. Recent critiques have highlighted the concerns of building long-term climate policy on such speculative technological scenarios emerging from orthodox modelling approaches – including integrated assessment modelling prominently assessed by the {IPCC}. Through a stakeholder consultation process with the {UK} modelling and policy community, we critically examine the integration of {GGR} technologies into {UK} Net Zero scenarios and the decision-making philosophy underlying the use of orthodox modelling to inform {UK} climate policy. We identify a number of features of orthodox modelling approaches which are unable to manage the pervasive extent of deep uncertainty in possible {UK} climate and energy futures. We further argue that a more fundamental issue lies in the way that the models are used by {UK} climate policy makers: that the handling of uncertainties which pervade the integration of {GGR} into Net Zero policy are resulting in substantial distortions in net-zero policy design and associated decision-making. Drawing on the principles of decision-making under deep uncertainty techniques, exemplified by Robust Decision Making, we recommend an alternative approach that explicitly embraces uncertainty, multiple values and diversity among stakeholders and viewpoints, and in which modelling exists in an iterative exchange with policy development rather than separate from it. We advocate that such an approach would provide more relevant and robust information to near-term policymaking and enable an inclusive societal dialogue about the appropriate role of {GGR} within {UK} climate policy.},

While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.},

In our experiment the participants were first asked to specify individually their willingness-to-pay for six monetary gambles. They were then paired at random into dyads, and were asked to specify their willingness-to-pay amount for the same gambles. The dyad’s willingness-to-pay amount was to be shared equally by the two individuals. Of the six gambles in our experiment, one involved no ambiguity and the remaining five involved different degrees of ambiguity. We found that dyads exhibited risk aversion as well as ambiguity aversion. The majority of the dyads exhibited a cautious shift in the face of ambiguity, stating a smaller willingness-to-pay than the two individuals’ average. Our study thus confirms the persistence of ambiguity aversion in a group setting and demonstrates the predominance of cautious shifts for dyads.},

Linear, scientistic conceptions of innovation are giving ground to more plural, socially situated understandings. Yet, growing recognition of social agency in technology choice is countered by persistently deterministic notions of technological progress. This article addresses this increasingly stark disjuncture. Distinguishing between “appraisal” and “commitment” in technology choice, it highlights contrasting implications of normative, instrumental, and substantive imperatives in appraisal. Focusing on the role of power, it identifies key commonalities transcending the analysis/participation dichotomy. Each is equally susceptible to instrumental framing for variously weak and strong forms of justification. To address the disjuncture, it is concluded that greater appreciation is required—in both analytic and participatory appraisal—to facilitating the opening up (rather than the closing down) of governance commitments on science and technology.},

This paper addresses this lacuna by drawing on United Kingdom based in-depth empirical research that made space for participatory appraisal experts to reflect on effective practice and novel questions of competence, expertise, and citizen-specialist relations within analytic-deliberative processes. Emerging practitioner principles warn that existing participatory models have not sufficiently considered constructivist perspectives on knowledge, analysis, and deliberation. Effective participatory appraisal under uncertainty needs to guard against the “technocracy of participation” by opening up to diversity, difference, antagonism, and uncertainties/indeterminacies.},

This interest in public deliberation has gained attraction in many practical settings, especially in the European Union, and holds the promise of more legitimate governance of science and technology. In this article, the authors draw on the European Commission’s ({EC}) report ‘‘Taking the European Knowledge Society Seriously’’ to ask how legitimate these efforts to ‘‘democratize’’ scientific expertise really are. While the report borrows from deliberative democrats’ normative accounts of legitimacy, the authors identify a tension between the principles for legitimate rule prescribed by deliberative democratic theory and the report’s celebration of diversity and dissent. While this inconsistency suggests that the legitimacy of deliberative governance arrangements is justified on empirical rather than normative grounds, it remains an open question whether studies of science and technology offer enough empirical support for such a justification.

	abstract = {Ambiguity aversion–the tendency to avoid options whose outcome probabilities are unknown—is a ubiquitous phenomenon. While in some cases ambiguity aversion is an adaptive strategy, in many situations it leads to suboptimal decisions, as illustrated by the famous Ellsberg Paradox. Behavioral interventions for reducing ambiguity aversion should therefore be of substantial practical value. Here we test a simple intervention, aimed at reducing ambiguity aversion in an experimental design, where aversion to ambiguity leads to reduced earnings. Participants made a series of choices between a reference lottery with a 50\% chance of winning \$5, and another lottery, which offered more money, but whose outcome probability was either lower than 50\% (risky lottery) or not fully known (ambiguous lottery). Similar to previous studies, participants exhibited both risk and ambiguity aversion in their choices. They then went through one of three interventions. Two groups of participants learned about the Ellsberg Paradox and their own suboptimal choices, either by actively calculating the objective winning probability of the ambiguous lotteries, or by observing these calculations. A control group learned about base-rate neglect, which was irrelevant to the task. Following the intervention, participants again made a series of choices under risk and ambiguity. Participants who learned about the Ellsberg Paradox were more tolerant of ambiguity, yet ambiguity aversion was not completely abolished. At the same time, these participants also exhibited reduced aversion to risk, suggesting inappropriate generalization of learning to an irrelevant decision domain. Our results highlight the challenge for behavioral interventions: generating a strong, yet specific, behavioral change.},

	abstract = {We explore how nuclear shut-downs in the United States could affect air pollution, climate and health with existing and alternative grid infrastructure. We develop a dispatch model to estimate emissions of {CO}2, {NOx} and {SO}2 from each electricity-generating unit, feeding these emissions into a chemical transport model to calculate effects on ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter ({PM}2.5). Our scenario of removing nuclear power results in compensation by coal, gas and oil, resulting in increases in {PM}2.5 and ozone that lead to an extra 5,200 annual mortalities. Changes in {CO}2 emissions lead to an order of magnitude higher mortalities throughout the twenty-first century, incurring {US}\$11–180 billion of damages from 1 year of emissions. A scenario exploring simultaneous closures of nuclear and coal plants redistributes health impacts and a scenario with increased penetration of renewables reduces health impacts. Inequities in exposure to pollution are persistent across all scenarios—Black or African American people are exposed to the highest relative levels of pollution.},

Simultaneously though there is a political need for gestures to smaller scale units and more deliberative procedures. The article argues that the Double Devolution concept simply ignores a rising volume of evidence that finds problems in operationalizing small-scale and deliberative ideas. Among other problems is the consequence that the resulting increased policy diversity is quickly labelled a ‘postcode lottery’. The article also reviews the deliberative literature to find serious questions raised about new biases that emerge in deliberative settings. Finally, the article adopts Hood’s work on cultural theory and public management to say that in fact evidence-based policy making may not be the norm - but policy selections reflect values and normative preferences.},

Sen’s treatment of democracy is however incomplete and inadequate: democracy is under-specified, there are unrecognized difficulties in any context featuring deep moral disagreement or deep division and a conceptualization of public reason in the singular erodes his pluralism. These faults undermine Sen’s account of justice. Developments in the theory of deliberative democracy can be deployed to remedy these deficiencies. This deployment points to a deliberative system encompassing those affected by collective decisions, with places for non-partisan forums and discursive representatives, conditionally open to multiple forms of communication, and geared to the production of workable agreements under normative and discursive meta-consensus. Democracy does not guarantee justice, but in a plural world it is essential to the pursuit of justice.},

Looking into participatory governance arrangements in the issue area of genetic testing in Germany and the {UK} the paper presents a typology of formats according to the way the respective public is constructed and identifies four major constructions of publics: the general public, the pure public, the affected public and the partisan public. Each of these enables certain speaking positions while foreclosing others.

This article develops an institutionalist framework to better appreciate the variegated nature of change in planning practices. It understands planning as embedded in, and simultaneously impacting on, three types of institutionalised norms: operational norms that define and allocate responsibilities among actors, collective norms that (re)produce planning polities and constitute the spatial-temporal context of their actions and constitutional norms that substantiate the idea of value defining the eligible stakeholders of a particular process. The article mobilises this framework and argues that contemporary planning practices convey a (a) shifting of responsibility towards individuals and households, (b) disaggregation of city regions through polycentric localism and (c) the reproduction of the process of accumulative valorisation of land. The article concludes reflecting on the complexity institutional change.},

	abstract = {Balancing multiple competing and conflicting objectives is an essential task for any artificial intelligence tasked with satisfying human values or preferences. Conflict arises both from misalignment between individuals with competing values, but also between conflicting value systems held by a single human. Starting with principle of loss-aversion, we designed a set of soft maximin function approaches to multi-objective decision-making. Bench-marking these functions in a set of previously-developed environments, we found that one new approach in particular, ‘split-function exp-log loss aversion’ ({SFELLA}), learns faster than the state of the art thresholded alignment objective method Vamplew (Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligenceg 100:104186, 2021) on three of four tasks it was tested on, and achieved the same optimal performance after learning. {SFELLA} also showed relative robustness improvements against changes in objective scale, which may highlight an advantage dealing with distribution shifts in the environment dynamics. We further compared {SFELLA} to the multi-objective reward exponentials ({MORE}) approach, and found that {SFELLA} performs similarly to {MORE} in a simple previously-described foraging task, but in a modified foraging environment with a new resource that was not depleted as the agent worked, {SFELLA} collected more of the new resource with very little cost incurred in terms of the old resource. Overall, we found {SFELLA} useful for avoiding problems that sometimes occur with a thresholded approach, and more reward-responsive than {MORE} while retaining its conservative, loss-averse incentive structure.},

	abstract = {People typically find bets less attractive when the probability of receiving a prize is more vague or ambiguous (Ellsberg, 1961). According to Fox and Tversky's (1995) comparative ignorance hypothesis, ambiguity aversion is driven by the comparison with more familiar events or more knowledgeable individuals, and diminishes or disappears in the absence of such a comparison. In this paper we emphasize that “comparative ignorance” refers to the state of mind of the decision maker. We extend the comparative ignorance hypothesis by documenting four new ways in which decision context can affect willingness to act under uncertainty that do not rely on the comparative-noncomparative evaluation paradigm used in previous studies. First, people find uncertain bets more attractive when preceded by questions about less familiar items than when preceded by questions about more familiar items. Second, the preference to bet on more familiar domains is less pronounced for the first domain evaluated on a survey than for later domains. Third, people find bets less attractive when they are provided with diagnostic information that they do not know how to use, compared to when they are provided with no such information. Finally, people are sensitive to the relative competence of their counterpart when playing a simple competitive (matching pennies) game, but not when playing a noncompetitive (coordination) game that has the same mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Communities in the United States are increasingly dependent upon aging infrastructure systems and challenged by more frequent and intense extreme weather events due in part to climate change. However, prioritizing resilience-related investments in these systems is hindered by the lack of performance metrics that objectively quantify the societal outcomes of infrastructure disruptions, such as power or water outages. This article outlines the process of developing an equity-focused resilience metric that captures the social consequences of infrastructure service disruptions on households. Theoretically grounded in the Capabilities Approach ({CA}) theory of human development, this metric focuses on estimating the burden of post-event adaptations taken by households to maintain their basic capabilities (e.g., ability to access food and water) and fulfill important household functionings (e.g., maintaining health and well-being). A travel cost method ({TCM}) that considers travel-related expenses, direct out-of-pocket expenses, and opportunity costs is presented as a way to measure the value of locations (e.g., grocery stores, emergency shelters, etc.) that provide services that enable households to maintain capabilities. A gravity-weighted model of accessibility is also discussed as a way to capture the value of having multiple potential service locations from which to choose and offers a way to capture important factors impacting a household’s ability to access important goods and services during outages. The proposed social burden metric equation incorporates the valuation principles of the {TCM} into the framework of the gravity model, resulting in a novel metric with strong methodological heritage. The article concludes by discussing the types of data needed to populate the proposed metric and future applications of this work that could inform the resilient infrastructure investments and planning necessary to mitigate the social burdens of power outages on vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {This article critically reviews the use of discursive approaches in studies of sustainable energy transitions. The review is motivated by calls to further incorporate social scientific methodologies into energy research and assess their contribution to policy. We strive to answer three questions: (1) which discursive approaches have been used to study sustainable energy transitions; (2) what thematic topics and issue areas have been covered and (3) what is the added value of discursive research designs? Our analysis is based on a review of 77 articles from the years 2004–2016. Our findings show that discursive approaches were mostly used to analyse institutional change and policy strategies at the national level and to examine energy choices through political ideology and the perceptions of publics. Nuclear power received most coverage, while renewable energy technologies were mainly studied through conflicts and opposition.

As such, they have raised high expectations among local activists and are increasingly supported by diverse funding schemes such as national programs. How can the social dynamics entangled in these initiatives be understood and assessed? A discourse analytical perspective, such as the Argumentative Discourse Analysis developed by Hajer, can bring valuable insights in this regard. This approach highlights the formation of discourse coalitions and processes of discourse structuration and institutionalization. In order to illustrate my conceptual and methodological considerations, I present an analysis of discursive dynamics observed in the alpine district of Murau, Austria, where the vision of reaching ‘energy autarky’ by the year 2015 has influenced regional development plans since 2003. The chosen discourse analytical approach has been very helpful in guiding the analysis of this case. Specific local conditions can explain why certain visions gained discursive hegemony.},

Planning recommendations made by dialogue are based on the intellectual force of arguments giving reasoned rankings of the planning alternatives. Dialogue encompasses the amalgamation of arguments in accordance with democratic criteria ensuring the communicative rationality of the process and the legitimacy of the recommendation. The balancing and weighing of arguments should avoid decision cycles that would make the recommendation of a plan arbitrary. By an analogy with Arrow’s theorem on the general impossibility of consistent and fair social choice, it is demonstrated that dialogue cannot ensure consistent recommendations and simultaneously prepare for political decision making in a democratic manner. The result is valid for debates over planning alternatives when differences in quality are not comparable across all the important arguments (concerning noise, safety, visual standard, social impact, etc.), which is the most common situation.},

The theorem stating the impossibility of a Paretian liberal says that a cycle-free collective decision procedure cannot be guaranteed with liberalism and preference sovereignty. Liberalism grants each individual some right to decide within his or her personal sphere, and preference sovereignty means that the Pareto principle is respected. It may be impossible to design procedures for planning and decision making simultaneously realizing the values of rationality, individual liberty, and the public interest. In light of social choice theory, the article examines whether the well-known modes of planning prescribe practices serving to alleviate this conflict or causing it to arise lessfrequently. The author concludes that several modes (e.g., disjointed incrementalism, critical pragmatism) hold such properties and shows how communicative planning helps to circumvent Sen's liberal paradox.},

But how should the two democratic mechanisms of deliberation and voting interact? In this article, we introduce a new axiom, which we call “Nonnegative Response toward Successful Deliberation” ({NNRD}). The basic idea is that if some individuals change their preferences toward other individuals’ preferences through democratic deliberation, then the social choice rule should not make everybody who has successfully persuaded others through reasoned deliberation worse off than what they would have achieved without deliberation. We prove an impossibility theorem that shows that there exists no aggregation rule that can simultaneously satisfy {NNRD} along with other mild axioms that reflect deliberative democracy's core commitment to unanimous consensus and political equality. We offer potential escape routes; however, each escape route can succeed only by compromising some core value of deliberative democracy.},

It is argued that the various criticisms made on Sen's characterisation of liberty are fundamental, and that Sen's subsequent defence of his position is unconvincing.

	abstract = {The growing threat of climate change and global tensions resulting in energy shortages has led many countries to reconsider the merit of nuclear energy to meet national emissions reduction targets and provide domestic energy security. Australia's unique nuclear experience has led to a prohibition on building nuclear reactors, distinctive from other G20 countries. With Australia's energy transition underway, an exploration of the discourse surrounding nuclear energy in the national debate is timely to understand the barriers and opportunities for nuclear power in our energy future. This article investigates how nuclear energy is framed in media and by debate stakeholders, how this potentially constraints the energy source, and the influence of an increasingly carbon-conscious world on the debate. A critical discourse analysis of nuclear energy in Australia and semistructured interviews are used to understand the discourse landscape. The study finds that the discursive practises of politically conservative social actors engaged in the debate significantly shape how nuclear energy is perceived and received by the public, contributing to a polarised and politicised debate. It highlights the significance of climate change and energy security discourses in sustaining media salience whilst exposing the exclusionary nature of select nuclear energy rhetoric which limit the debate. Further research into public perceptions and discourses around nuclear energy in Australia is required given the need to decarbonise.},

The reformulation integrates discussions of process tracing and causal-process observations, gives greater attention to description as a key contribution, and emphasizes the causal sequence in which process-tracing observations can be situated. In the current period of major innovation in quantitative tools for causal inference, this reformulation is part of a wider, parallel eﬀort to achieve greater systematization of qualitative methods. A key point here is that these methods can add inferential leverage that is often lacking in quantitative analysis.

This study explores how different energy systems models and scenarios explicitly represent and assess potential disruptions and discontinuities. The focus is on futures studies and forward-looking scenario and modelling exercises. We apply definitions of ‘emergent’ (uncoordinated) and ‘purposive’ (coordinated) disruption to a systematic review on how energy systems models and scenarios have been used to capture disruption and discontinuity. We first conducted a review of reviews of energy models and scenarios to provide an overview of their common classifications. Additional searches then sought studies which use different types of models and scenarios to explore disruption and discontinuity. We analyse a subset of 30 of these modelling or scenario studies in which authors self-identify and represent disruption or discontinuity, finding that the most frequently used methods were qualitative, exploratory foresight scenarios or agent-based models. We conclude that policy makers could prepare more effectively for social, economic and political disruption by integrating multidisciplinary insights from social and political sciences, engineering and economics through a broader range of methods: exploratory, foresight scenarios, simulation and agent-based models and repurposed energy systems optimisation models.},

The constructed narrative provides an operational theoretical foundation for choosing energy provision technologies that can be considered socially sustainable and offers an alternative to prioritizing the cost-minimization mindset. Through a case of household electricity provision in Sub-Saharan Africa, the narrative is applied as a set of theoretical assumptions for energy system modelling. The presented model explores to what extent different combinations of centralized, decentralized, fossil-fuel-based and renewables-based electricity access provision are compatible with the principles of socially sustainable energy system design. Comparing three different scenarios of electricity access provision using centralized and decentralized fossil-fuel-based and renewables-based electricity generation technologies, this study concludes that decentralized and renewables-based electricity generation mixes are associated with higher cost but also with greater social sustainability benefits. By combining a conceptual narrative of socially sustainable energy systems with system dynamics modelling, theoretical work on sustainable energy system development is bridged with the energy system modelling practice. The research design of this study may interest scholars working on the theoretical development of sustainable energy system principles and their application in modelling as well as energy system modellers.},

A collaborative analysis led by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that using existing technologies, and at modest cost, we can achieve a zero-carbon, equitable transportation system by 2050. This transformation is made possible by phasing out petroleum and transitioning to low and zero-carbon fuels. This eliminates tailpipe emissions that endanger communities, and at the same time keeps our climate targets within reach. To get there, we need to rapidly electrify vehicle fleets; strengthen efficiency standards for both electric and internal-combustion engine vehicles; reduce emissions from the remaining liquid fuels in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as aviation, shipping, and long distance road transportation; and enable communities to reduce or eliminate the need to drive. Achieving these goals will require a suite of forward-thinking policies and regulations at all administrative levels that are implemented with meaningful community engagement.},

	abstract = {Recent fire seasons have fueled intense speculation regarding the effect of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire in western North America and especially in California. During 1972–2018, California experienced a fivefold increase in annual burned area, mainly due to more than an eightfold increase in summer forest-fire extent. Increased summer forest-fire area very likely occurred due to increased atmospheric aridity caused by warming. Since the early 1970s, warm-season days warmed by approximately 1.4 °C as part of a centennial warming trend, significantly increasing the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit ({VPD}). These trends are consistent with anthropogenic trends simulated by climate models. The response of summer forest-fire area to {VPD} is exponential, meaning that warming has grown increasingly impactful. Robust interannual relationships between {VPD} and summer forest-fire area strongly suggest that nearly all of the increase in summer forest-fire area during 1972–2018 was driven by increased {VPD}. Climate change effects on summer wildfire were less evident in nonforested lands. In fall, wind events and delayed onset of winter precipitation are the dominant promoters of wildfire. While these variables did not change much over the past century, background warming and consequent fuel drying is increasingly enhancing the potential for large fall wildfires. Among the many processes important to California's diverse fire regimes, warming-driven fuel drying is the clearest link between anthropogenic climate change and increased California wildfire activity to date.},

The warmer and windier conditions corresponding to a 2 × {CO}2 climate scenario produced fires that burned more intensely and spread faster in most locations. Despite enhancement of fire suppression efforts, the number of escaped fires (those exceeding initial containment limits) increased 51\% in the south San Francisco Bay area, 125\% in the Sierra Nevada, and did not change on the north coast. Changes in area burned by contained fires were 41\%, 41\% and –8\%, respectively. When interpolated to most of northern California's wildlands, these results translate to an average annual increase of 114 escapes (a doubling of the current frequency) and an additional 5,000 hectares (a 50\% increase) burned by contained fires. On average, the fire return intervals in grass and brush vegetation types were cut in half. The estimates reported represent a minimum expected change, or best-case forecast. In addition to the increased suppression costs and economic damages, changes in fire severity of this magnitude would have widespread impacts on vegetation distribution, forest condition, and carbon storage, and greatly increase the risk to property, natural resources and human life.},

	abstract = {The policies of population relocation put in train following the severe nuclear reactor accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi in 2011 are examined using the Judgement- or J-value. Here relocation is taken to mean a movement of people that is long-term or permanent. A review is made of a 1992 {IAEA}/{CEC} study of the Chernobyl countermeasures, which includes data from which the effectiveness of the 1986 and post-1990 relocations may be judged using the J-value. The present analysis provides endorsement of that study’s conclusion that the post-1990 relocation of 220,000 members of the public could not be justified on the grounds of radiological health benefit. Moreover, application of the J-value suggests that the first Chernobyl relocation is economically defensible for between 26\% and 62\% of the roughly 115,000 people actually moved in 1986. Thus only between 9\% and 22\% of the 335,000 people finally relocated after Chernobyl were justifiable, based on the J-value and the data available. Nor does the J-value support the relocation of the 160,000 people moved out on a long-term basis after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. The J-value results for these very severe nuclear accidents should inform the decisions of those deciding how best to respond to a big nuclear accident in the future. The overall conclusion is that relocation should be used sparingly if at all after any major nuclear accident. It is recognised that medical professionals are seeking a good way to communicate radiation risks in response to frequent requests from the general public for information and explanation in a post-accident situation. Radiation-induced loss of life expectancy, which lies at the heart of the application of the J-value to nuclear accidents, is proposed as an information-rich yet easy to understand statistic that the medical profession and others may find helpful in this regard.},

We demonstrate that these model parameters can be constrained by empirical measurement, and the resulting models can be used to investigate the mechanisms underlying belief dynamics in actual societies. We use data from two longitudinal studies of belief change, one on 80{\textasciitilde}individuals living in an {MIT} dorm during the 2008 presidential election season, and another on 94{\textasciitilde}participants recruited from Mechanical Turk during the 2016 presidential election primary season.

Specifically, applications to public policy and corporate strategies have proliferated in tandem. This paper reviews the most used complex systems methodologies with an emphasis on public policy. We briefly present examples, pros, and cons of agent-based modeling, network models, dynamical systems, data mining, and evolutionary game theory. Further, we illustrate some specific experiences of large applied projects in macroeconomics, urban systems, and infrastructure planning. We argue that agent-based modeling has established itself as a strong tool within scientific realm. However, adoption by policy-makers is still scarce. Considering the huge amount of exemplary, successful applications of complexity science across the most varied disciplines, we believe policy is ready to become an actual field of detailed and useful applications.},

	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree \$k\$ follows a power law, decaying like \$k{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, often with \$2 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha {\textless} 3\$. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.},

Some argue that failing to find reciprocal food sharing means that some process other than reciprocity must be occurring, whereas others argue for models that allow reciprocity to span domains in the form of trade.2 Multilayer networks, high-dimensional networks that allow us to consider multiple sets of relationships at the same time, are ubiquitous and have consequences, so processes giving rise to them are important social phenomena. The analysis of multi-dimensional social networks has recently garnered the attention of the network science community.3 Recent models of these processes show how ignoring layer interdependencies can lead one to miss why a layer formed the way it did, and/or draw erroneous conclusions.6 Understanding the structuring processes that underlie multiplex networks will help understand increasingly rich datasets, giving more accurate and complete pictures of social interactions.},

	abstract = {Nuclear reactors that are small and modular—reactors that generate up to about a third 
the power of the typical commercial reactor—have 
received positive attention in Congress and elsewhere 
as a possible way of introducing nuclear generating 
capacity in smaller and more affordable increments.
Advocates assert that cost savings would be realized by mass-producing major components as standard 
modules in factories, and shipping the modules to sites 
for assembly rather than having each reactor custom-designed and built. Smaller-sized reactors would also 
have lower construction costs. Supporters also state 
that designs for small modular reactors ({SMRs}) would 
be inherently safer, so they could be located closer to 
densely populated areas than large reactors, even replacing coal-fired power plants at existing sites. Proponents 
even claim that certain safety regulations of the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission could be relaxed for {SMRs}.
Less expensive does not necessarily mean cost-effective, however. The safety of the proposed compact 
designs is unproven—for instance, most of the designs 
call for weaker containment structures. And the arguments in favor of lower overall costs for {SMRs} depend 
on convincing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to relax existing safety regulations.Reactor owners can be tempted to lower costs by 
cutting corners. The challenge is to reduce cost with out compromising safety and security. Given that the 
Fukushima Daiichi accident review has already resulted 
in new safety requirements for both operating and 
new reactors, some of which may be costly, we need 
research that will show how to lower the cost of 
nuclear reactor systems while increasing their levels of 
safety and security. Safety and security improvements are critical if nuclear power is to be a viable energy source for the future. 
To this end, Congress should direct the Department of Energy ({DOE}) to spend taxpayer money only 
on support of technologies that have the potential to 
provide significantly greater levels of safety and security than currently operating reactors. The {DOE} should 
not be promoting the idea that {SMRs} do not require 10-mile emergency planning zones—nor should it be encouraging the {NRC} to weaken its other requirements 
just to facilitate {SMR} licensing and deployment},

The remaining energy requirements will be met by fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Smaller, less-capital intensive nuclear reactors are emerging as an alternative to fossil fuel and large nuclear systems. Approximately 50 small ({\textless}300 {MWe}) to medium-sized ({\textless}700 {MWe}) reactors ({SMRs}) concepts are being pursued for use in electricity and cogeneration (combined heat and power) markets. However, many of the {SMRs} are at the early design stage and full data needed for economic analysis or market assessment is not yet available. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop “target cost” estimates for reactors deployed in a range of competitive market situations (electricity prices ranging from 45–150 €/{MWh}). Parametric analysis was used to develop a cost breakdown for reactors that can compete against future natural gas and coal (with/without carbon capture) and large nuclear systems. Sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impacts on competitiveness from key cost variables. This study suggests that {SMRs} may effectively compete in future electricity markets if their capital costs are controlled, favorable financing is obtained, and reactor capacity factors match those of current light water reactors. This methodology can be extended to cogeneration markets supporting a range of process heat applications.},

Employing these methodological recommendations, we conducted a collaborative, inclusive, and equitable research design and engagement practice by collaborating with Tribal members on research with expressly mutual benefits. In this work, a years-long collaboration of Tribal members and non-Tribal researchers developed a methodology to survey respondents at an accessible and culturally relevant community event to learn about preferences and perceived barriers to transitioning to {RE}. A second contribution is empirical. The results suggest shared priorities for energy solutions that enhance energy sovereignty, i.e., community control and ownership of energy services provisioning. They also demonstrate widespread awareness regarding barriers to a {RE} transition and simultaneously, some potential misperceptions about the challenges to transition. This study reinforces the need for {SA} research to move beyond asking what technologies receive public support and where those technologies should be sited to consider how access and transparency in planning processes, collaboration, engagement, development, ownership, and benefits are organized and can be radically reconfigured to enable the just transition to a decarbonized energy system.},

	abstract = {All tea plants in India rely on the national grid for their electrical needs and diesel for their thermal energy and transportation, which are encountering high costs, high emissions, and issues of accessibility. In this paper, hybrid renewable systems based on both standalone and grid-connected technologies have been modeled using {HOMER} Pro software for supplying power to a tea manufacturing plant in a typical rural area in India, namely, Gudalur village (Nilgiris), geographically located at 11°30.2′N and 76°29.5′E, which is presently run by the state grid to meet their energy requirements. The different configurations comprised of Solar {PV}, biomass, hydro, electrolyzer, boiler, thermal load controller to utilize excess electricity, and waste heat recovery options, and lead-acid batteries were designed to meet 650 {kWh}/day of electricity for processing units, 101 {kWh}/day of electricity for general applications, 4,450 {kWh}/day of thermal energy, and 86.35 kg/day of hydrogen energy. To determine the most feasible system design among various scenarios, several criteria such as {NPC}, {COE}, {LCOH}, and {CO}2 emission of the system have been investigated. In the case of off-grid hybrid systems, results show the highest {NPC} of \$7.01 M with an {LCOE} of \$1.06/{kWh} is obtained for the diesel generator/boiler/reformer/{TLC} system. It is reduced to \$1.75 M with an {LCOE} of −\$.420/{kWh} for the {PV}/biomass-{CHP}/hydro/{TLC} scenario. In a grid-connected system, the maximum {NPC} of \$6.20 M with an {LCOE} of \$0.835/{kWh} is obtained for a diesel generator/boiler system, and it is reduced to −\$10.5 M with an {LCOE} of −\$.240/{kWh} for the {PV}/biomass-{CHP}/hydro/{TLC} scenario. Additionally, in the off-grid systems, the {PV}/biomass-{CHP}/hydro/{TLC} system has {LCOH} of \$4.27/kg, which is economical with the highest renewable fraction of 93\%. The {PV}/biomass-{CHP}/hydro/{TLC} hybrid system has the lowest {LCOH} of −\$64.5/kg with a maximum renewable fraction of 96\% in on-grid systems. The findings show that recovering excess electricity and waste heat would increase renewable fraction, decrease the energy cost and emissions from the system, and emphasize the importance of {TLC} and {CHP} in {HRES}. According to the simulation results, the grid-connected system is more cost-effective than a stand-alone system due to the revenue obtained from selling renewable power to the grid.},

In this chapter, we explore the complex interlinkages between them, and tease out implications for contemporary energy analysis and policymaking. Energy poverty is framed in the literature as lack of access to electricity networks and dependence on solid fuels for cooking. We expand this definition by adding lack of access to energy services. Energy security is conceptualized as minimizing the vulnerability of vital energy systems and enabling the provision of energy services. Energy sovereignty is concerned with decision making and enabling people to follow certain energy use patterns. Furthermore, energy sovereignty emphasizes the role of local people and their institutions in determining their energy systems in ways that are culturally relevant and ecologically sustainable. In the first three sections of this chapter, we explore the three key overlapping concepts – energy poverty, energy security, and energy sovereignty – individually, and in the final section explain how they interact, and what this interaction means both for scholars interested in energy as well as for policymakers and planners seeking to address energy problems.},

For the same generation rate, the climatic impacts from solar photovoltaic systems are about ten times smaller than wind systems.

The criteria are classified into five groups. ‘Planet’ results demonstrate that the incompatibility of nuclear expansion with electricity efficiency and full renewable power deployment largely overshadows the carbon-free steam generation of nuclear fission. ‘Prosperity’ analyses show that including rolled-off costs and risks would raise bills to heights difficult to quantify due to doubts, long-term invisibility and irreversibility. ‘Risks’ may be catastrophic and are not insurable, while weaponry proliferation adds a further dimension. ‘People’ analyses reveal that some nuclear power is affordable for present generations when many costs remain unpaid; however, developing countries cannot afford the capital costs and technology intensity, and catastrophes wreak havoc on national economies, singling out exposed communities losing their habitats. ‘Politics’ assessments demonstrate that nuclear technocracy dominates the scene in many countries; the technocrats heavily influence policy-makers, the media, and celebrities speaking out in favor of nuclear.

	abstract = {This paper reflects on the various possible nuclear power production methods from an ethical perspective. The production and consumption of nuclear power give rise to the problem of intergenerational justice; in other words, we are depleting a nonrenewable resource in the form of uranium while the radiotoxic waste that is generated carries very long-term potential burdens. I argue that the morally desirable option should therefore be to seek to safeguard the interests of future generations. The present generation has at least two duties with regard to posterity: (1) not to jeopardize the safety and security of future generations or impose any harm upon them and (2) to sustain future well-being insofar as that is possible with the available energy resources. These duties are presented as pluralist prima facie duties (or duty-imposing reasons) thus implying that they could well be overruled by morally more compelling duties. If we are unable to fulfill both these prima facie duties simultaneously, it should be particularly the duty not to impose harm on posterity that should be the leading incentive behind nuclear power production. This supports the arguments in favor of the introduction of a new fuel cycle (partitioning and transmutation) that can substantially reduce the waste lifetime and therefore also potential future burdens. However, the further development and application of this scientifically proven but not yet industrialized fuel cycle give rise to additional burdens for contemporaries. This paper examines the extent of the moral stringency of the no harm duty sought for situations in which future interest should guide us in our choosing of a certain technology.},

	abstract = {Despite the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, a growing number of countries are interested in expanding or introducing nuclear energy. However, nuclear energy production and nuclear waste disposal give rise to pressing ethical questions that society needs to face. This book takes up this challenge with essays by an international team of scholars focusing on the key issues of risk, justice, and democracy. The essays consider a range of ethical issues, including radiological protection, the influence of gender in the acceptability of nuclear risk, and environmental, international, and intergenerational justice in the context of nuclear energy. They also address the question of when, and under which conditions, nuclear energy should play a role in the world's future supply of electricity, looking at both developing and industrialized countries. The book will interest readers in ethics and political philosophy, social and political sciences, nuclear engineering, and policy studies.},

Currently, the {USEPA} uses the linear no-threshold ({LNT}) model to estimate cancer risks and determine cleanup levels in radiologically contaminated environments. The {LNT} model implies that there is no safe dose of ionizing radiation; however, adverse effects from low dose, low-dose rate ({LDDR}) exposures are not detectable. This article (1) provides the scientific basis for discontinuing use of the {LNT} model in {LDDR} radiation environments, (2) shows that there is no scientific consensus for using the {LNT} model, (3) identifies {USEPA} reliance on outdated scientific information, and (4) identifies regulatory reliance on incomplete evaluations of recent data contradicting the {LNT}. It is the time to reconsider the use of the {LNT} model in {LDDR} radiation environments. Incorporating the latest science into the regulatory process for risk assessment will (1) ensure science remains the foundation for decision making, (2) reduce unnecessary burdens of costly cleanups, (3) educate the public on the real effects of {LDDR} radiation exposures, and (4) harmonize government policies with the rest of the radiation scientific community.},

	abstract = {The linear no-threshold ({LNT}) model was introduced into the radiological protection system about 60 years ago, but this model and its use in radiation protection are still debated today. This article presents an overview of results on effects of exposure to low linear-energy-transfer radiation in radiobiology and epidemiology accumulated over the last decade and discusses their impact on the use of the {LNT} model in the assessment of radiation-related cancer risks at low doses. The knowledge acquired over the past 10 years, both in radiobiology and epidemiology, has reinforced scientific knowledge about cancer risks at low doses. In radiobiology, although certain mechanisms do not support linearity, the early stages of carcinogenesis comprised of mutational events, which are assumed to play a key role in carcinogenesis, show linear responses to doses from as low as 10 {mGy}. The impact of non-mutational mechanisms on the risk of radiation-related cancer at low doses is currently difficult to assess. In epidemiology, the results show excess cancer risks at dose levels of 100 {mGy} or less. While some recent results indicate non-linear dose relationships for some cancers, overall, the {LNT} model does not substantially overestimate the risks at low doses. Recent results, in radiobiology or in epidemiology, suggest that a dose threshold, if any, could not be greater than a few tens of {mGy}. The scientific knowledge currently available does not contradict the use of the {LNT} model for the assessment of radiation-related cancer risks within the radiological protection system, and no other dose-risk relationship seems more appropriate for radiological protection purposes.},

	abstract = {Most cancers are multifactorial diseases. Yet, epidemiological modeling of the effect of ionizing radiation ({IR}) exposures based on the linear no-threshold model at low doses ({LNT}) has generally not included co-exposure to chemicals, dietary, socio-economic and other risk factors also known to cause the cancers imputed to {IR}. When so, increased cancer incidences are incorrectly predicted by being solely associated with {IR} exposures. Moreover, to justify application of the {LNT} to low doses, high dose-response data, e.g., from the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are linearly interpolated to background incidence (which usually has large uncertainty). In order for this interpolation to be correct, it would imply that the biological mechanisms leading to cancer and those that prevent cancer at high doses are exactly the same as at low doses. We show that linear interpolations are incorrect because both the biological and epidemiological evidence for thresholds, or other non-linearities, are more than substantial. We discuss why the {LNT} model suffers from misspecification errors, multiple testing, and other biases. Moreover, its use by regulatory agencies conflates vague assertions of scientific causation, by conjecturing the {LNT}, for administrative ease of use.},

While our societies have to face the issue of finding new energy models which help to mitigate climate change, global approaches are mandatory to select the relevant improvements for the different energy systems, including nuclear energy. In a first step, this paper focuses on the specific environmental footprint of nuclear energy and its position with regards the other energy sources.

Among the energy-mix, nuclear power is anticipated to have very low {GHG}-emissions. However, its viability is severely addressed by the public opinion after the Fukushima accident. Therefore, a global {LCA} of the French nuclear fuel cycle was performed as a reference model. Results were compared in terms of impact with other energy sources. It emphasized that the French nuclear energy is one of the less impacting energy, comparable with renewable energy. In a second, part, the French scenario was compared with an equivalent open fuel cycle scenario. It demonstrates that an open fuel cycle would require about 16\% more natural uranium, would have a bigger environmental footprint on the “non radioactive indicators” and would produce a higher volume of high level radioactive waste.},

Even with the best safety record of all types of electricity generation, it is time to move away from legacy nuclear to reap the benefits of a truly renewable source of safe clean energy, advanced nuclear. Solar and wind cannot hold a renewable candle to the vast renewable potential of advanced nuclear energy. The transition to carbon-neutral energy can best be made with advanced nuclear, in safety, waste minimization, true renewability for thousands of years, process heat for manufacturing, and a viable means of replacing our chemical manufacturing dependence on fossil fuels. Some of my colleagues tell me, “There are few opportunities for chemical engineers in nuclear”. I disagree. Opportunities include design and operation of high-temperature (550–750 °C) plants involving molten salts, liquid metal, and helium; application of this high-temperature capability for industrial process heating; recycling legacy nuclear ‘waste’ to provide fuel for advanced reactors; integration of the hydrogen economy into nuclear plant design and operation; improvement in moving pebble-bed advanced reactor technology; mining improvements for uranium and thorium, including mining uranium from seawater; molten salt storage systems for improving load following functionality and to provide process heat functionality; resolving corrosion challenges in molten salt reactors; and retrofitting existing oil-and-gas-based refineries to operate as nuclear biorefineries.},

	abstract = {Some integrated assessment studies of climate change have concluded that nuclear energy has a large potential impact on carbon abatement costs. However, these studies have often modeled the cost of nuclear waste management very simply or neglected it entirely. Common difficulties with existing studies include the use of simplistic nuclear waste management cost models and implicitly minimizing costs in the distant future by using discount rates that are arguably inappropriate for intergenerational cost-benefit analysis. These difficulties lead to results that may underestimate the cost of nuclear waste management – and therefore overestimate the value of nuclear energy as a low carbon energy technology. Here, we consider how a more realistic treatment of the nuclear waste disposal problem than has been used in previous studies could affect the viability of nuclear power in the context of integrated assessments of climate change. We construct a generic nuclear waste management cost model to develop cost estimates for nuclear waste management based on current policy, practice, and cost estimates for storage and disposal technologies. Our cost estimates are discounted using conventional constant exponential discounting as and a declining discount rate scheme. Results suggest that the optimism reflected in previous works is fragile: More realistic nuclear waste management cost models and uncertainty-appropriate intergenerational discount rates produce many more scenarios in which nuclear waste management costs are higher than previously assumed. As a consequence, nuclear energy’s economic attractiveness as a low carbon energy option is appears to be lower than earlier works suggested.},

For the purpose of mathematically modeling the system’s adequacy, two-state generator models are applied; and for the purpose of the load curve, a relative cumulative frequency histogram, with polynomial interpolation among classes, is used. The security assessment discussed herein is based on the continued load flow charts obtained using the Newton–Raphson method that can monitor the voltage system’s behavior to load increases. A modal analysis is also conducted in order to identify, from an overall perspective, the nodes that most contribute to loss of voltage stability in the system. Both assessments take into account the performance of the system stability limits. These limits are established on the basis of certain state variables, such as voltage range at each node, thermal limits on the transmission lines, and the reactive power limits of the generating units.},

The increasing presence of variable renewable generation in power systems presents a challenge to these methods because, unlike thermal units, variable renewable generation levels change over time because they are driven by meteorological events. Thus, capacity value calculations for these resources are often performed to simple rules of thumb. This paper follows the recommendations of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's Integration of Variable Generation Task Force to include variable generation in the calculation of resource adequacy and compares different reliability metrics. Examples are provided using the Western Interconnection footprint under different variable generation penetrations.},

	abstract = {Jurisdictions around the world are enacting and enforcing an increasing number of policies to fight
climate change, leading to higher penetration of variable renewable energy ({VRE}) and energy stor age systems ({ESSs}) in the power grid. One of the biggest challenges associated with this process is
the evaluation of the appropriate amount of {ESS} required to mitigate the variability of the {VREs} and
achieve decarbonization goals of a particular jurisdiction. This report presents methodologies de veloped and results obtained for determining the minimum amount of {ESS} required to adequately
serve load in a system where fossil fueled generators are being replaced by {VREs} over the next
two decades. This technical analysis is performed by Sandia National Laboratories for the {DOE}
Office of Electricity Energy Storage Program in collaboration with the Illinois Commerce Com mission ({ICC}). The Illinois {MISO} Zone 4 is used as a case study. Several boundary conditions
are investigated in this analysis including capacity adequacy and energy adequacy to determine
the quantity of {ESS} required for {MISO} Zone 4. Multiple scenarios are designed and evaluated to
incorporate the impact of varying capacity values of {VREs} and on the resource adequacy of the
system. Several retirement scenarios involving fossil-fueled assets are also considered. Based on
the current plans of new additions and retirements of generating assets, the results of the technical
analysis indicate that Illinois {MISO} Zone 4 will require a significant quantity of {ESS} to satisfy
their electricity demand over the next two decades.},

The {IEA}’s 2050 Net Zero transition pathways all involve some degree of nuclear power, highlighting its potential as a low-carbon electricity source. Greenhouse gas emissions of nuclear power reported in the life cycle assessment literature vary widely, from a few grams of {CO}2 equivalents to more than 100 g/{kWh}, globally. The reasons for such a variation are often misunderstood when reported and used by policymakers. To fill this gap, one can make {LCA} models explicit, exploring the role of the most significant parameters, and develop simplified models for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. We developed a parametric cradle-to-grave life cycle model with 20 potentially significant variables: ore grade, extraction technique, enrichment technique, and power plant construction requirements, among others. Average {GHG} emissions of global nuclear power in 2020 are found to be 6.1 g {CO}2 equiv/{kWh}, whereas pessimistic and optimistic scenarios provide extreme values of 5.4–122 g {CO}2 equiv/{kWh}. We also provide simplified models, one per environmental impact indicator, which can be used to estimate environmental impacts of electricity generated by a pressurized water reactor without running the full-scale model.},

Our research examined whether there was a difference in the acceptance of nuclear energy across 27 European countries in 2009, before the Fukushima accident. In particular, we analyzed how each factor at the individual and contextual level influences the acceptance. To answer this question, we set up the acceptance of nuclear energy as a dependent variable, and 5 perception variables at the individual level and 11 structural ones at the contextual level as independent variables. We executed multilevel modeling by using a Eurobarometer survey, which covered 27 European countries. The analysis results showed that at the individual level, the perceived benefit explained the largest variance of the acceptance, followed by perceived risk and trust. At the contextual level, the share of the energy supply by nuclear power, environmentalism and ideology influenced the acceptance of nuclear energy. This study shows that individuals’ acceptance of nuclear energy is based on individual beliefs and perceptions, but it is also influenced by the institutional and socio-cultural context which each country faces.},

	abstract = {The transition to a low-carbon electricity system is likely to require grid-scale energy storage to
smooth the variability and intermittency of renewable energy. I investigate whether private incentives
for operating and investing in grid-scale energy storage are optimal and the need for policies that
complement investments in renewables with encouraging energy storage. In addition to arbitraging
inter-temporal electricity price differences, storage induces non-pecuniary externalities due to pro duction efficiency and carbon emissions. I build a new dynamic structural equilibrium framework to
quantify the effects of grid-scale energy storage and apply it to study the South Australian Electric ity Market. My equilibrium framework adds key modeling features to the literature by allowing (1)
storage’s price impact and (2) incumbents to best response to energy storage’s production. The best
responses’ estimation uses the best responses from conventional sources to observed variation in the
residual demand volatility. We find that (1) ignoring price impact of energy storage may lead large
biases as arbitrage revenue diminish fast with the size, (2) although entering the electricity market is
not profitable for privately operated storage, such entry would increase consumer surplus and reduce
emissions, (3) load ownership for energy storage leads to twice as much improvement in consumer
surplus, and (4) entry of energy storage reduces renewable generators’ revenue by decreasing average
prices at moderate levels of renewable power, however, for high renewable generation capacity lev els, storage increases the return to renewable production and reduces {CO}2 emissions by preventing
curtailment during low-demand periods},

We consider the deployment of storage in the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Centralized scheduling leads to the lowest power system cost, reducing mean electricity prices by up to 7\% relative to decentralized scheduling. This could avoid annual bill increases of up to 407 £m/year and could decrease electricity price volatility by up to 60\%, depending on the installed storage capacity on the grid. We show that aggregators could reduce the disparity between private and system value by financially incentivizing consumers to give up control of their storage resource in order to use it more efficiently for the benefit of the wider electricity system.},

We model this for short-term (daily) storage in the British electricity wholesale market, with generating companies acting as either price-takers or Cournot competitors. We discuss how competitive storage charging and discharging behaviour depends on the balance between the market price and shadow price of stored electricity. Electricity storage raises welfare, consumer surplus and renewable generators’ revenues, while reducing revenues for conventional generators. Market power in storage slightly reduces the welfare gains; Cournot behaviour by generators reduces welfare but has relatively little impact on the incremental effect of storage. Market power in electricity storage is undesirable, but market power in generation is much worse. The interactions between market power in generation and in storage are complex, suggesting that predictions from one market may not apply elsewhere and context-specific modelling will be valuable.},

	abstract = {Price volatility and increasing renewable energy generation have raised interest in the potential opportunities for storage technologies in energy-only electricity markets. In this paper we explore the value of a price-taking storage device in such a market, the National Electricity Market ({NEM}) in Australia. Our analysis suggests that under optimal operation, there is little value in having more than six hours of storage in this market. However, an inability to perfectly forecast wholesale prices, particularly extreme price spikes, may warrant some additional storage. We found that storage devices effectively provide a similar service to peak generators and are similarly dependent on and exposed to extreme price events, with revenue for a merchant generator highly skewed to a few days of the year. As a consequence of this finding, and in contrast to previous studies, the value of storage was found to be relatively insensitive to the round trip efficiency. We also found that the variability of revenue and exposure to extreme prices could be reduced using common hedging strategies, such as those currently used by peak generators. We present a case study that demonstrates storage technologies using such strategies may have a competitive advantage over other peaking generators in the {NEM}, due to the ability to earn revenue outside of extreme peak events. Similar to traditional peak generators, a main driver for storage options in an energy-only electricity market is extreme prices, which in turn is dependent on capacity requirements. However storage technologies can receive additional revenue streams, which may be improved by increased integration of renewable energy.},

Currently, most research has focused on estimating the energy required to provide the {DLS}. However, no attempt has been made to estimate the material consumption needed to provide the {DLS}. Thus, we ask the following questions: First, what is the amount of materials in stocks and flows needed to provide a {DLS}? Second, which lifestyle and technology choices are effective in providing a {DLS} without creating an excessive demand for additional materials? To provide a {DLS}, a material footprint ({MF}) of 6 t/(cap*yr) with a lower and upper bound between 3 and 14 t/(cap*yr) is required. The direct and indirect in-use stocks required are estimated at 32 t/cap and 11 t/cap, respectively. Nutrition (39\%) and mobility (26\%) contribute the most to total {MF}. Buildings account for 98\% of direct stocks, while the construction sector accounts for 61\% of indirect stocks. We extend the coverage of the {DLS} by including the collective service dimension and link the material stock-flow-service nexus and life cycle assessment to compute the {MF} and in-use stocks needed to provide the {DLS}.},

	abstract = {Changes in the nature, intensity, and frequency of climate-related extreme events have imposed a higher risk of failure on energy systems, especially those at the community level. Furthermore, the evolving energy demand patterns and transition towards renewable and localised energy supply can affect energy system resilience. How can an energy system be planned and reconfigured to address these challenges without compromising the system's resilience against chronic stresses and extreme events? Unlike energy system reliability, resilience is neither a common nor an explicit consideration in energy master planning at the community level. In addition, there is no universally agreed-upon method or metrics for measuring or estimating resilience and defining mitigation strategies. This paper introduces a multi-layered energy resilience framework and set of metrics for energy master planning of communities, including the new generation of district energy systems. The potential system disturbances and their short and long-term impacts on various components of the energy system are discussed for commonly expected and extreme events. Three layers of energy resilience are discussed: engineering-designed resilience, operational resilience, and community-societal resilience. A starting set of energy resilience metrics to support engineering design and energy master planning for communities is identified. Implications for future research and practice are noted.},

The environmental and financial costs of waste treatment options were evaluated using a bottom-up approach. Based on current installations and future projections, 7.7 to 23.1 million tonnes of blade waste will be generated in China by 2050.

The study explores various recycling methods—mechanical, thermal, and chemical—each with unique advantages and limitations. Mechanical recycling, while efficient, faces economic and environmental constraints. Thermal methods, particularly pyrolysis, effectively break down organic materials but are energy-intensive. Chemical processes are adept at recovering high-purity materials but struggle with ecological and cost considerations. The review also highlights multifaceted challenges in recycling, including hazardous by-product generation, environmental impact, and the economic feasibility of recycling infrastructures. The conclusion emphasizes the need for innovative, sustainable, and economically viable recycling technologies.

The effects of pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time, flue gas composition and heating mode on the pyrolysis product were investigated, and the pyrolysis mechanism was also analyzed. Finally, the industrial implementation scheme of pyrolysis process in coal-fired power plants was formulated. The results showed that the matrix resin of wind turbine blades could be carbonized and then oxidized by direct heating with the flue gas. A clean glass fiber was finally obtained to recycle. When the blade was pyrolyzed at 420–450 ℃ for 5–6 h, the purity of recycled fiber was above 99 \% and its tensile strength decrease was less than 10 \% compared with the original fiber. During the pyrolysis process, the concentration of {SO}2 in flue gas had little effect on the quality of recycled fiber because of its nonreactivity with {SiO}2. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the purity of recycled fiber increased while its tensile strength decreased. In coal-fired power plants, a small fraction of flue gas was pumped from the tail flue of boiler by a fan. The flue gas after dust removal was sent to a recovery furnace, where the blade was pyrolyzed. The tail gas was transported to the boiler furnace for complete combustion and then purified by the existing pollutant purification devices in the power plant. According to the above scheme, the recycling of waste wind turbine blades in coal-fired power plants could be readily realized by equipping a duster, a recovery furnace and a fan.},

This study employs panel dynamic Generalised Method of Moments ({GMM}) and panel Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares ({FMOLS}) to investigate the effects of electricity production from nuclear source, electricity production from non-renewables and trade openness on {CO}2 emissions.

	abstract = {Recently, the estimation of accident costs within the social costs of nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) has garnered substantial interest. In particular, the risk aversion behavior of the public toward an {NPP} accident is considered an important factor when integrating risk aversion into {NPP} accident cost. In this study, an integrated framework for the external cost assessment of {NPP} accident that measures the value of statistical life ({VSL}) and the relative risk aversion ({RRA}) coefficient for {NPP} accident based on an individual-level survey is proposed. To derive the willingness to pay and the {RRA} coefficient for {NPP} accident risks, a survey was conducted on a sample of 1550 individuals in Korea. The estimation obtained a mean {VSL} of {USD} 2.78 million and an {RRA} coefficient of 1.315. Based on the estimation results in which various cost factors were considered, a multiplication factor of 5.16 and an external cost of {NPP} accidents of 4.39E−03 {USD}-cents/{kWh} were estimated. This study is expected to provide insight to energy policy decision-makers on analyzing the economic validity of {NPP} compared to other energy sources by reflecting the estimated external cost of {NPP} accident into the unit electricity generation cost of {NPP}.},

Inaccurate estimation may result in delay and cost overrun, and accordingly jeopardizing the nuclear power plant's operating license. To reliably estimate projects schedule and cost, the causal factors of delay in nuclear power plant projects need to be carefully investigated and analyzed. This study presents a framework for identifying causal factors of delay for operable nuclear power plants projects. This framework is designed in three main stages: (1) collecting data on projects that experienced delay for various reasons (e.g., missing schedule updates, design errors, scope change); (2) identifying the reasons for delay into standard common causal factors; and (3) analyzing the identified causal factors of delay and their impact on projects schedule and cost performance. This framework will assist decision-makers (e.g., nuclear project managers and project controllers) in identifying and evaluating the nuclear projects causal factors of delay to improve the reliability of projects schedule and cost estimation.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants generate over 60\% of the carbon-free electricity in the U.S. Due to a decrease in electricity prices as a result of the availability of cheaper natural gas and increased low-cost renewables, many of these plants are at risk of premature retirement. If nuclear power plants retire, {CO}2 emissions in many U.S. states could increase, even while the states comply with {EPA} legislation aimed at mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. In this paper, we perform a Monte Carlo-based analysis to determine the breakeven price of electricity these plants must secure in order to avoid financial loses between 2015 and 2040, and find median breakeven electricity prices to range between \$35 and \$73 per {MWh}. Based on our estimates of future electricity prices under a low natural gas price scenario from the Energy Information Administration, our analysis suggests that U.S. nuclear plants would require between \$8 and \$44 per {MWh} (median results) on top of electric sales revenue in order to breakeven. Assuming natural gas plants would replace retired nuclear power plants, we estimate an equivalent cost of avoided {CO}2 emissions to be \$18-\$30 per metric ton of avoided {CO}2 (median results) for multi-reactor nuclear plants, and \$47-\$97 per metric ton of avoided {CO}2 (median results) for single-reactor plants. Preserving the existing nuclear power plant fleet, especially multi-reactor plants, is thus a cost effective carbon-avoidance strategy compared to the social cost of carbon.},

In total, these projects required about {\textbackslash}39 billion in investment and reached about 11 {GW} of installed capacity. We use this original dataset to test six hypotheses about construction cost overruns related to (i) technological learning, (ii) fiscal control, (iii) economies of scale, (iv) configuration, (v) regulation and markets and (vi) manufacturing experience. We find that across the entire dataset, the mean cost escalation per project is 6.5\% or about {\textbackslash}63 million per windfarm, although 20 projects within the sample (39\%) did not exhibit cost overruns. The majority of onshore wind farms exhibit cost underruns while for offshore wind farms the results have a larger spread. Interestingly, no significant relationship exists between the size (in total {MW} or per individual turbine capacity) of a windfarm and the severity of a cost overrun. Nonetheless, there is an indication that the risk increases for larger wind farms at greater distances offshore using new types of turbines and foundations. Overall, the mean cost escalation for onshore projects is 1.7\% and 9.6\% for offshore projects, amounts much lower than those for other energy infrastructure.

	abstract = {This paper assesses the economic benefits of 57 World Bank Group-sponsored hydropower dam plant investments. Hydropower dams are among the main sources for producing electricity and the largest renewable source for power generation throughout the world. Hydropower dams are often a lower-cost option for power generation in Clean Energy Transition for addressing global climate change. Despite its conspicuous aspects, constructing hydropower dams has been controversial. Considering the World Bank’s long history as the largest hydropower development financier, this study investigates its performance in supporting hydropower dams. The outcomes of this study apply to the wider hydropower development community. Of the projects in this study, 70\% experienced a cost overrun, and more than 80\% of projects experienced time overruns, incurring potential additional costs as a result. Despite the high cost and time overruns, this hydropower portfolio of dams produced a present value of net economic benefits by 2016 of over half a trillion {USD}. Based on our findings, the evaluated hydropower portfolio helped avoid over a billion tonnes of {CO}2 for an estimated global environmental benefit valued at nearly {USD} 350 billion. The projects’ additional environmental benefits raise the real rate of return from 15.4\% to 17.3\%. The implication for hydropower developers is that the projects’ assessment should consider cost and time overrun and factor them into the project-planning contingency scenarios. There is a considerable benefit for developing countries to exploit their hydropower resources if they can be developed according to industry practices and international standards. The case for developing hydropower may be stronger when considering its climate benefits. The net economic benefits of hydropower can be even higher if there is a greater effort to manage cost and time overruns.},

Three studies explored the environmental risk attitudes of participants with different levels of power toward environmental governance of nuclear energy. Results revealed that power affects environmental risk attitudes and perception, with low-power being associated with more risk-avoiding and negative attitude toward the development of nuclear energy relative to high-power.

In this paper, we introduce a complementary perspective highlighting two fundamental factors: public opinions and their dynamics or stability. We provide results of a longitudinal survey (2 measurements 1year apart) on plans for a nuclear waste repository in Switzerland. The respondents (N=841) submitted their own arguments with which they would discuss the site selection process. In addition, we surveyed the respondents’ general opinions. We found a focus on values and responsibility. Those in favor of the repository used different arguments than those who opposed it or were undecided on it. Women perceived the repository more negatively (general opinion) but did not use different arguments than men. A comparison over time showed that one third of the sample did not change their argumentation. The use of descriptive data to enhance policy-making processes is discussed.},

We show analytically that these costs consist of disutility caused by unnecessary anxiety - due to misperceived risks relating to existing reactors - and where licenses for new nuclear reactors are not granted, delayed or totally lost energy production. Empirical evidence is derived from Finnish surveys eliciting explicitly the importance of risk perceptions on preferences regarding nuclear power and its environmental and economic impacts. We show that the estimated marginal impact of a high perceived risk of nuclear accident is statistically significant and that such a perception considerably decreases the probability of a person supporting nuclear power. This result holds across a number of robustness checks including an instrumental variable estimation and a model validation by observed voting behavior of the members of Parliament. The public's risk perceptions translate into a significant social cost, and are likely to affect the revenues, costs and financing conditions in the nuclear power sector in the future.},

Identifying the root causes of these issues is critical to finding practical solutions. This study focuses on the Egyptian construction sector and identifies the top six factors that lead to cost overruns and delays in mega construction projects. These factors are inadequate project planning, poor communication and coordination, changes in project scope, lack of skilled labour, insufficient budget allocation, and payment delays. The study recommends strategies to mitigate these factors, such as involving all stakeholders in the planning process, using project management tools, and setting realistic timelines to improve project planning and scheduling. Regular meetings and clear communication channels can achieve effective communication and coordination. The study also suggests managing changes in project scope through effective change management processes and ensuring sufficient budget allocation by conducting accurate cost estimates and setting aside contingency funds. These recommendations can provide practical insights for practitioners and policymakers in the construction industry to mitigate the impact of cost overruns and delays.

	abstract = {Uncertainty, risk, and rework make it extremely challenging to meet goals and deliver anticipated value in complex projects, and conventional techniques for planning and tracking earned value do not account for these phenomena. This article presents a methodology for planning and tracking cost, schedule, and technical performance (or quality) in terms of a project’s key value attributes and threats to them. It distinguishes four types of value and two general types of risks. The “high jumper” analogy helps to consider how high the “bar” is set for a project (its set goals) and therefore how challenging and risky it will be. A project’s capabilities as a “jumper” (to clear the bar and meet its goals) determine the portion of its value at risk ({VaR}). By understanding the amounts of value, risk, and opportunity in a project, project managers can design it for appropriate levels of each. Project progress occurs through reductions in its {VaR}: Activities “add value” by chipping away at the project’s “anti-value”—the risks that threaten value. This perspective on project management incentivizes generating results that eliminate these threats, rather than assuming that value exists until proven otherwise.},

In this study we address the issue of uncertainty in cost projections by applying reference class forecasting ({RCF}) in order to improve the reliability of costs used for making decisions under uncertainty. This technique makes it possible to closely link contingency estimates to the likely incidence of uncertainty of construction costs for hydroelectric dams. A case study, the Bujagali dam in Uganda, is used to demonstrate how investment appraisal can be enhanced to better account for the risk of cost overruns. While this project has suffered from cost overruns, the net benefits of the dam are still expected to be substantial. We conclude that if historical information from the major financiers of dams is accessible, learning from the past can help to reduce the cost of uncertainty in power planning worldwide.},

While there is consensus that generation technologies need to be low on greenhouse gas emissions, the question of whether to use renewables or nuclear to meet this power demand is highly controversial. Both options still require financial support and this is not going to change in the near future. This raises the question of where public money should be invested in order to achieve greater economic efficiency: into support for renewable energies ({RE}) or support for nuclear power plants? This paper sets out to answer this question. The detailed model-based prospective scenario assessment performed in this study provides the basis for estimating future cost developments. After discussing the existing support schemes for renewables, the paper compares these with a nuclear model. The comparison is conducted exemplarily for the United Kingdom ({UK}) at a country level and for the {EU} 28 overall. The recent state aid case for the construction of the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant ({NPP}) in the {UK} serves as the model for the nuclear option.},

The chapter presents the results of a linear regression analysis of the construction costs involved with 401 electricity infrastructure projects built between 1936 and 2014 in fifty-seven countries. Included in this sample are dozens of hydroelectric dams, nuclear reactors, thermoelectric power plants, utility-scale solar facilities, wind farms, and transmission projects that collectively required more than \$800 billion of investment and constituted more than 325,000 megawatts of capacity. The chapter shows that larger projects such as hydroelectric dams and nuclear power plants are highly correlated with cost overruns, and that wind farms and solar facilities are negatively correlated. This finding implies that smaller, more flexible, decentralised systems have a suite of (possibly undervalued) factors that make them less prone to the risk of an overrun.},

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the probability distribution function of cost overruns and delays in the construction of power generation projects, with a particular focus on mega hydroelectric dams recently built in Brazil. Results show that construction costs were, on average, 97.53\% above the initial estimates. The distribution that best fits the hydroelectric power plants costs overruns is the gamma distribution. For the delays, the construction completion time had an average increase of 74.28\%, or 3.5 years. The distribution that best fits the hydroelectric plants delays is the lognormal distribution. The essential statistical message obtained in this paper is that megaprojects fail to deliver the economies of scale embedded in large projects because the exposure to risk is disproportionate to the financial economies they can generate. Decision makers should carefully evaluate whether "bigger is better".},

Leveraging a literature review, in-depth discussions, and a questionnaire survey, this paper aims to identify and rank general elements hindering {SMR} construction, specific licensing and regulatory elements affecting {SMR} construction, and elements favouring or hindering the reuse of {SMR} modules. The results show that financial and economic issues (including perceived investment risk, availability of cheaper technologies to generate electricity) are the main barriers for {SMR} construction. Government support for financing the first-of-a-kind and developing a supply chain could allow overcoming these barriers. Time, cost and risk of the licensing process are critical elements for {SMR} construction; therefore, policies should be in place to support stakeholders. The economic feasibility can hinder the opportunity of reusing {SMR} modules. Design and interface standardisation are the main enabling factors of reusing {SMR} modules.

	abstract = {Nuclear energy sources, in particular the small modular reactor ({SMR}), are being recognized as low-emission clean energy sources. The development of {SMRs} has focused on minimizing their carbon footprint while ensuring that energy is generated in a safe and cost-competitive manner, which leads to a worldwide growing interest in {SMR} deployments. In addition, there is a strong demand for renewable energy sources; however, their output can be influenced significantly by weather and location. Therefore, integration of renewable energy sources with {SMRs} and an energy storage system, which results in a nuclear renewable hybrid energy system ({NR}-{HES}), is required to improve power generation reliability. {NR}-{HES} represents a promising energy system solution for off-grid communities and industries, especially those involving remote mining sites. In the present study, an off-grid {NR}-{HES} to meet electrical and thermal demands is considered for the Victor mine site in northern Ontario, Canada. Off-grid remote mines in Canada primarily rely on diesel generators. The proposed {NR}-{HES} is composed of {SMR} units with a thermal capacity of 15 {MWth} each, two wind turbines with a capacity of 2.3MWe each, a two-tank molten salt thermal storage system, a hydrogen storage facility, and peaking diesel generators. To achieve a near-zero-emission mining site, electric vehicles are proposed in the mining site energy demand structure. A transient thermodynamics model is developed to simulate the {NR}-{HES} and generate hourly variation of sustainability performance parameters that include power cycle efficiency, {SMR} capacity factor, round-trip efficiency of the storage systems, thermal storage state of charging, and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, an economic analysis is performed to determine the additional annualized cost of the system relative to a baseline site. The simulation has a test matrix of 16 runs with various combinations of design input parameters, namely {SMR} thermal power, storage duration (e.g., daily, seasonally, or monthly), and thermal storage system volume. Grey relational analysis ({GRA}) is used as a level-based multi-objective optimization technique to determine the nearest optimal design parameter (e.g., decision variable) combination within the test matrix and thus the optimal configuration. In addition, the {GRA} ranks the design input parameters based on how significantly each parameter can affect the overall performance of the {NR}-{HES}. Results revealed that optimal sustainable perspectives have a significant influence on the overall system parameters and performance. For instance, the results showed that there is an opportunity to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 94.8\% with a minimal impact to system annualized cost if the cost and environmental effect objectives were prioritized over other sustainability performance parameters.},

	abstract = {Predicting future costs of technologies not yet developed is a complex exercise that includes many uncertain parameters and functional forms. In that context, small modular reactor ({SMR}) concepts that are in a rather early development stage claim to have cost advantages through learning effects, standardized design, modularization, co-siting economies, and other factors, such as better time-to-market even though they exhibit negative economies of scale in their construction costs due to their lower power output compared to conventional nuclear reactors. In this paper, we compare two different approaches from production theory and show that they have a theoretically equal structure. In the second step, we apply these approaches to estimate a range of potential construction costs for 15 {SMR} projects for which sufficient data is available. These include water cooled, high temperature, and fast neutron spectrum reactors. We then apply the Monte Carlo method to benchmark the cost projections assumed by the manufacturers by varying the investment costs, the weighted average cost of capital, the capacity factor, and the wholesale electricity price in simulations of the net present value ({NPV}) and the levelized cost of electricity ({LCOE}). We also test whether the differences between the manufacturer estimates and ours differ between technology families of {SMR} concepts and apply a sensitivity analysis. Here we contribute to an intensifying debate in the literature on the economics and finance of {SMR} concepts. The Monte Carlo analysis suggests a broad range of {NPVs} and {LCOEs}: Surprisingly, the lowest {LCOE} is calculated for a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor, whereas all of the light water reactors feature higher {LCOEs}. None of the tested concepts is able to compete economically with existing renewable technologies, not even when taking their variability and necessary system integration costs into account. The numerical results also confirm the importance of the choice of production theory and parameters. We conclude that any technology foresight has to take as much of the case specifics into account, including technological and institutional specifics; this also holds for {SMR} concepts.},

Unfortunately, there are no large-N studies investigating the time for completion of such large-scale projects. For the first time, we statistically explain the duration of the construction of all initiated nuclear plant projects so far. Based on the International Atomic Energy׳s comprehensive Power Reactor Information System ({PRIS}) we assess the impact of demographic, economic, and political preconditions of a country, at the same time accounting for different types of reactor technologies. To account for non-linear relationships, we apply non-parametric survival models with P-splines. A main result of our analysis is that time of connection to grid increases over the years indicating increased societal sensibilities, respect for higher security standards, and increased project complexities.

They also propose to compare final installed costs for nuclear power plants, encompassing construction and finance costs, across different national economies and time periods encompassing a wide range of macro-economic circumstances and finance arrangements that overwhelm any signal from trends associated with the actual construction costs of the plants in question.

We find that nuclear reactors are the riskiest technology in terms of mean cost escalation as a percentage of budget and frequency; that hydroelectric dams stand apart for their mean cost escalation in total dollars; that many of the hypotheses grounded in the literature appear wrong; and that financing, partnerships, modularity, and accountability may have more to do with overruns than technology.},

	abstract = {Nuclear plant costs in the {US} have repeatedly exceeded projections. Here, we use data covering 5 decades and bottom-up cost modeling to identify the mechanisms behind this divergence. We observe that nth-of-a-kind plants have been more, not less, expensive than first-of-a-kind plants. “Soft” factors external to standardized reactor hardware, such as labor supervision, contributed over half of the cost rise from 1976 to 1987. Relatedly, containment building costs more than doubled from 1976 to 2017, due only in part to safety regulations. Labor productivity in recent plants is up to 13 times lower than industry expectations. Our results point to a gap between expected and realized costs stemming from low resilience to time- and site-dependent construction conditions. Prospective models suggest reducing commodity usage and automating construction to increase resilience. More generally, rethinking engineering design to relate design variables to cost change mechanisms could help deliver real-world cost reductions for technologies with demanding construction requirements.},

In this research, we collect and analyze a large sample comprised of 5,392 {IT} projects to empirically examine the probability distribution of {IT} project cost overruns. Further, we propose and examine a mechanism that can explain such a distribution. Our results reveal that {IT} projects are far riskier in terms of cost than normally assumed by decision makers and scholars. Specifically, we found that {IT} project cost overruns follow a power-law distribution in which there are a large number of projects with relatively small overruns and a fat tail that includes a smaller number of projects with extreme overruns. A possible generative mechanism for the identified power-law distribution is found in interdependencies among technological components in {IT} systems. We propose and demonstrate, through computer simulation, that a problem in a single technological component can lead to chain reactions in which other interdependent components are affected, causing substantial overruns. What the power law tells us is that extreme {IT} project cost overruns will occur and that the prevalence of these will be grossly underestimated if managers assume that overruns follow a normal or near-normal distribution. This underscores the importance of realistically assessing and mitigating the cost risk of new {IT} projects up front.},

However, such an interpretation has no support in the official definitions of the principle that have been adopted by the European Union and by the signatories of international treaties on environmental protection. In these documents, the precautionary principle is a guideline specifying how to deal with certain types of scientific uncertainty. In this contribution, this approach to the precautionary principle is explicated with the help of concepts from the philosophy of science and comparisons with general notions of practical rationality. Three major problems in its application are discussed, and it is concluded that to serve its purpose, the precautionary principle has to (1) be combined with other decision principles in cases with competing top priorities, (2) be based on the current state of science, which requires procedures for scientific updates, and (3) exclude potential dangers whose plausibility is too low to trigger meaningful precautionary action.},

The large integration of renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, has further caused additional uncertainties due to the variable and unpredictable nature of these resources. However, the next generation smart power systems are also equipped with enabling technologies such as control, communication, and powerful computing capabilities that could be utilized to better deal with these uncertainties and operate the power system at a stable, reliable, and economic operating point. Stochastic optimization is a powerful tool that enables power system operators to deal with such uncertainties.

As a result, there have been significant advancements over the recent years in {IES} modeling, planning, and operation, especially the treatment of uncertainty factors. This paper reviews the development of {IES} planning approaches focusing on modeling of uncertainty factors. Firstly, coordinated {IES} planning frameworks, processes and techniques are surveyed and categorized including their application scenarios, advantages and disadvantages, they are then compared with traditional grid planning. Secondly, the modeling of uncertainty factors was systematically reviewed and summarized. {IES} planning methods under uncertainty are further divided into a number of categories, such as probability optimization, stochastic optimization, robust optimization, possibility and mixed probability-possibility optimization. The uncertainty modeling methodologies are summarized and compared, including applications of uncertainty models in different situations. Finally, discussions on development trends, challenges and research directions in uncertainty modeling for {IES} planning are presented and recommendations are made.},

It is commonly claimed that the principle is paralyzing, unscientific and promotes a culture of irrational fear. The risk and safety literature contains considerable work providing support for such claims but also argumentation backing the principle. The present paper aims at contributing to this discussion by investigating the principle in view of what is here referred to as contemporary risk and safety science. Common beliefs about the principle are revisited. New insights are obtained by clarifying the risk and safety fundamentals necessary to understand the principle’s motivation, applicability and limitations. The paper concludes that the precautionary principle is only relevant when the uncertainties and risks are considerable and scientific. Confusion arises, as the principle is mixed with the basic idea of risk management to give weight to uncertainties, in order to prudently handle risk. Properly understood and implemented, the precautionary principle can be aligned with decision analysis and other scientific methods.},

Uncertainty is best seen as a relation, allowing a clear separation of the object, source and ‘owner’ of the uncertainty, and we argue that all expressions of uncertainty are constructed from judgements based on possibly inadequate assumptions, and are therefore contingent. We consider a five-level structure for assessing and communicating uncertainties, distinguishing three within-model levels—event, parameter and model uncertainty—and two extra-model levels concerning acknowledged and unknown inadequacies in the modelling process, including possible disagreements about the framing of the problem. We consider the forms of expression of uncertainty within the five levels, providing numerous examples of the way in which inadequacies in understanding are handled, and examining criticisms of the attempts taken by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to separate the likelihood of events from the confidence in the science. Expressing our confidence in the adequacy of the modelling process requires an assessment of the quality of the underlying evidence, and we draw on a scale that is widely used within evidence-based medicine. We conclude that the contingent nature of risk-modelling needs to be explicitly acknowledged in advice given to policy-makers, and that unconditional expressions of uncertainty remain an aspiration.},

Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information.   The research presented in this paper finds that information requires three (not mutually exclusive) attributes - salience, credibility, and legitimacy - and that what makes boundary crossing difficult is that actors on different sides of a boundary perceive and value salience, credibility, and legitimacy differently.  Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Nino forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.},

It focuses on the uncertainty perceived from the point of view of those providing information to support policy decisions (i.e., the modellers’ view on uncertainty) – uncertainty regarding the analytical outcomes and conclusions of the decision support exercise. Within the regulatory and management sciences, there is neither commonly shared terminology nor full agreement on a typology of uncertainties. Our aim is to synthesise a wide variety of contributions on uncertainty in model-based decision support in order to provide an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for systematic uncertainty analysis. To that end we adopt a general definition of uncertainty as being any deviation from the unachievable ideal of completely deterministic knowledge of the relevant system. We further propose to discriminate among three dimensions of uncertainty: location, level and nature of uncertainty, and we harmonise existing typologies to further detail the concepts behind these three dimensions of uncertainty. We propose an uncertainty matrix as a heuristic tool to classify and report the various dimensions of uncertainty, thereby providing a conceptual framework for better communication among analysts as well as between them and policymakers and stakeholders. Understanding the various dimensions of uncertainty helps in identifying, articulating, and prioritising critical uncertainties, which is a crucial step to more adequate acknowledgement and treatment of uncertainty in decision support endeavours and more focused research on complex, inherently uncertain, policy issues.},

However, there has been little attention to evaluating economic and regulatory (E\&R) uncertainties, despite their enormous impact on the project cashflows. Consequently, this review analyzes, classifies, and discusses 130 articles dealing with the design of renewable energy projects under E\&R uncertainties. After performing a survey and identifying the selected manuscripts, and the few previous reviews on the matter, the following innovative categorization is designed: sources of uncertainty, uncertainty characterization methods, problem formulations, solution methods, and regulatory frameworks. The classification reveals that electricity price is the most considered source of uncertainty, often alone, despite the existence of six other equally influential groups of E\&R uncertainties. In addition, real options and optimization arise as the two main approaches researchers use to solve problems in energy system design. Subsequently, the following aspects of interest are discussed in depth: how modeling can be improved, which are the most influential variables, and potential lines of research. Conclusions show the necessity of modeling E\&R uncertainties with currently underrepresented methods, suggest several policy recommendations, and encourage the integration of prevailing approaches.},

	abstract = {Currently, uncertainty in energy systems is an ongoing issue, particularly in modern renewable energy systems, where it is difficult to accurately describe current or future states of parameters in power systems because of the many uncertainty issues that could expose the systems to potential issues. This is why identifying uncertainties is not a simple task or a straightforward issue. Nowadays, there are different strategies to model these uncertainties. Each has its strengths and limitations. Hence, much attention should be paid to managing uncertainty in energy systems and mitigating their potential risks both at the planning and operational stage. Although predicting uncertainty at the planning stage can deviate from the real situation, it can always be liberated at the operational stage. In this chapter, models of the uncertainty of parameters in modern power systems such as uncertainty models of load demand, wind energy, photovoltaic energy, plug-in electric vehicles, electricity price, and load growth are summarized to bring together several aspects of uncertainty management in power systems in planning and operation stages within an integrated framework. Then, uncertainty modeling methods are presented in detail. Finally, the related future trends are explored.},

This paper reviews the representation of uncertainty in power market models for operational planning and forecasting. A synthesis of previous reviews is used to find the prevalence of stochastic tools in power and energy system applications, and it concludes that most approaches are deterministic. A selection of power market tools handling uncertainty is reviewed in terms of the uncertain parameters they capture, and the methods used to describe them. These all use probabilistic methods and typically cover weather-related uncertainty, including demand. Random outages are also covered by several short-term power market models, while uncertainty in fuel and {CO}\$\$\_2\$\$emission prices were generally not found to be included, nor other types of uncertainty. A gap in power market models representing multiple dimensions of uncertainty, solvable on a realistic, large-scale system in a reasonable time, is identified. The paper concludes with a discussion on topics to address when representing uncertainty, where the main challenges are that uncertainty can be difficult to describe and quantify, and including uncertainty adds additional complexity and computational burden to the problem.},

Meta-analysis needs the use of statistical methods that can be descriptive and/or inferential to summarizing data from several studies on the specific topic of interest. The techniques help to generate knowledge from multiple studies both in qualitative and quantitative ways. The usual method has four basic steps: search (define searching string and types of databases), appraisal (pre-defined literature inclusion and exclusion, and quality assessment criteria), synthesis (extract and categorized the data), and analysis (narrate the result and finally reach into conclusion) ({SALSA}). However, this work added two steps which are research protocol (define the research scope) and reporting results (stating the procedure followed and communicating the result to the public) at the initial and last step, respectively. As a result, the new method has six basic steps which are abbreviated as {PSALSAR}. Therefore, this method is applicable to assess the existing knowledge, trends, and gaps in ecosystem services. In sum, this literature review method presents: •The {PSALSAR} method is an explicit, transferable and reproducible procedure to conduct systematic review work.•It helps to assess both quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the literature review.•The procedure listed here added two basic steps (protocol and reporting result) on a commonly known {SALSA} framework.},

The source side mainly considers the intermittent and volatility of renewable energy output. The load side mainly considers the uncertainty of load forecast errors. The network side mainly considers the characteristics of equipment under variable conditions, equipment failures, and the uncertainty of the coupling of multi-energy flow systems. The energy storage side mainly considers the uncertainty of mobile energy storage grid connection and virtual energy storage participation in demand response. The multi-energy trading market mainly considers the uncertainty of market trading methods and market operation mechanisms. Then, various integrated energy system uncertainty modeling techniques and solving methods are summarized. Finally, it looks forward to the future research directions and challenges faced by the optimal operation of the integrated energy system under the influence of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {In this study, generation expansion planning ({GEP}) is executed with the lowest cost and pollutant emission, highest efficiency, and lowest loss of load probability ({LOLP}). A hybrid energy system integrated with nuclear and renewable sources will be a potential candidate for a carbon-free energy network. Integration of nuclear and renewable energy tackles the demerits present when they operate individually. In this new approach, the expansion of modular reactors and renewable energy is discussed in the presence of uncertainties raised by load demand, load duration curve ({LCD}), energy carrier prices, power plant depreciation rates, weather conditions, and renewables output. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is fulfilled to find the best reactor expansion capacity. Firstly, all uncertainties are modeled by their probability density function ({PDF}). Then a modified Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) coupled with the Wilks method was implemented to predict the stochastic behavior of different uncertainty sources exactly so that reaching to 90\% reliability of the final plan. Finally, the approach is integrated into {WASP}-{IV} software to provide the optimal number of sources with optimal cost and pollutants. The results indicate that the {LOLP} index in the last year of the study period is only 1.4\%–2.5\%, and the number of installed nuclear units are 3 {SMART} reactor per 2 years just by 10\% of tolerance, owing to considering all the uncertainties in the expansion process after sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the emission of pollutants is about zero.},

In the recent decade, Modeling to Generate Alternatives gained popularity for considering structural uncertainty in Energy System Optimization Models. Modeling to Generate Alternatives finds numerous near-optimal alternatives, which could give the impression that all alternatives are comparably good. However, if one could compare near-optimal shadow prices of energy demand, certain alternatives would be superior to other solutions. Nevertheless, shadow prices of near-optimal solutions reflect the effort of being different and no approach to calculate expedient shadow prices of near-optimal solutions (comparable to the optimal one) has been presented. A simple approach is suggested and discussed with its implications, using an example scenario. The obtained shadow prices further differentiate the quality of solutions in the near-optimal solution space. Deeper analysis reveals regional or temporal bottlenecks of solutions and can help identify better search directions for alternative solutions. To some extent, the shadow prices highlight effects of parametric uncertainty, even though the proposed method cannot counteract this uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The decarbonisation of the German heating sector is challenging but necessary when aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. Therefore, a fast reduction of the energy demand side and an increase of renewable energy on the supply side is required. However, related efficiency (energetic modernisation) and consistency (renewable energy) measures are limited through their potential, expansion speed, resources and acceptance. Sufficiency as an underrepresented measure has a high potential for heat demand reductions and can thus also relax pressure on the supply side. Nevertheless, sufficiency measures in the heating sector have not been investigated thoroughly. In this study we present scenarios for the German heating sector including efficiency, consistency and sufficiency measures and analyse their compliance with limiting global warming to 1.5 °C. The results of the model-based analysis show that efficiency measures and renewable energy in combination with heat pump expansion are not sufficient. Sufficiency measures, such as a reduced living space, have a high {CO}2-emission reduction potential and must be considered as one important pillar for a successful heat sector transformation.},

This study proposes and compares the priori and the posteriori modeling approaches for optimizing the design of distributed energy systems under uncertainty. The posteriori approach is developed as a Monte Carlo simulation combined with the deterministic programming model, while the priori approach is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model. Both approaches consider economic and environmental objectives and use the same set of uncertainty parameters based on a case study in Shanghai. The results show that, compared with the priori-approach model, the posteriori-approach model leads to an underestimation of the total annual cost, but their total annual carbon emission approximates. Besides, the Pareto frontier cliques from the posteriori approach demonstrate the distributions of system performance, whereas the priori approach can capture the uncertainties at the substantially higher computational cost. Finally, the tradeoff between model complexity and computational cost is discussed to generate more insights on the optimal design, i.e., configuration and dispatch, of distributed energy systems.},

Then Monte Carlo method is implemented to solve the stochastic model providing real situation. In the Monte Carlo simulation you have a range of values as a result, and you are able to understand the risk and uncertainty in the model. Deterministic models used for conventional economic dispatch problems are not able to address some real conditions in practical applications. Deterministic models of power system applications are incapable to express the uncertainties that come from energy demand and supply of intermittent renewable systems. Due to the presence of these various uncertain variables stochastic attitude is inevitable in practical applications.

	abstract = {This study identifies supply options for sustainable urban energy systems, which are robust to external system changes. A multi-criteria optimization model is used to minimize greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions and financial costs of a reference system. Sensitivity analyses examine the impact of changing boundary conditions related to {GHG} emissions, energy prices, energy demands, and population density. Options that align with both financial and emission reduction and are robust to system changes are called “no-regret” options. Options sensitive to system changes are labeled as “potential-risk” options. There is a conflict between minimizing {GHG} emissions and financial costs. In the reference case, the emission-optimized scenario enables a reduction of {GHG} emissions (−93\%), but involves higher costs (+160\%) compared to the financially-optimized scenario. No-regret options include photovoltaic systems, decentralized heat pumps, thermal storages, electricity exchange between sub-systems and with higher-level systems, and reducing energy demands through building insulation, behavioral changes, or the decrease of living space per inhabitant. Potential-risk options include solar thermal systems, natural gas technologies, high-capacity battery storages, and hydrogen for building energy supply. When energy prices rise, financially-optimized systems approach the least-emission system design. The maximum profitability of natural gas technologies was already reached before the 2022 European energy crisis.},

However, the techno-economic nature of energy system models has opened for discussions about how well societal aspects are represented. Studying justice implications in energy systems modelling is an opportunity to inform policy-makers and the broader society how long-term changes to energy systems may affect different social groups and how to minimise injustices. In this paper, we review how, and to what extent, aspects of social justice have been included in energy systems optimisation modelling as well as areas for future research. In addition to reviewing published journal articles and reports, we organise a workshop with energy system modellers and social scientists, providing qualitative information on past approaches and potential future venues. We identify 3 key findings: (i) Exploring alternative system configurations to cost-optimality is receiving increasing attention and typically done through a ‘modelling to generate alternatives’ approach, (ii) among formalised definitions of distributional justice, equality (equal distribution) is the most common equity principle. There is at the same time little reflection on the choice and impact of equity principles, potentially contributing to an overly narrow understanding of justice. (iii) Among the workshop participants, participatory approaches which involves stakeholders and lay people are considered a potential future area of research, especially for making modelling results and processes more accessible and impactful to the wider public.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, notions of energy justice have been subject to significant uptake within energy studies. One conception, often referred to as a “three-tenet approach”, has quickly become the predominant definition of energy justice, being cited and applied in a range of publications. Yet, dominant versions of this approach are subject to a recurring set of issues which risk concealing the meaning and use of justice in approaching the ethics of energy systems. The rapid uptake of this approach combined with its on-going integration with other framings, including the recent {JUST} framework, risks further entrenching these issues within a range of energy studies trajectories. Key to understanding these issues are the activist-based accounts of environmental justice that informed an earlier understanding of justice as distribution, recognition, and procedure. This perspective illustrates that relative to this understanding, this approach to energy justice 1) omits the explanatory interconnections between these three dimensions and 2) conceals the depth and debate underpinning each separate dimension. Revealing the origins, depth, and purpose of this earlier understanding illustrates how the dominant approach to energy justice creates a normative-ethical foundation that does not always support its overarching goals nor adequately produces a conceptual space in which to understand and respond to energy related injustice. Compounding this, some advocates of these approaches often fail to incorporate the values embodied in this framework when rationalising its use. I conclude with a call to energy researchers to engage more critically with energy justice frameworks.},

	abstract = {The concept of planetary justice has received increasing attention within the field of earth systems governance. Although a significant epistemic shift, planetary justice discussions have primarily focused on western and (re)distributive notions of justice. By doing so, planetary justice is depriving current debates of crucial dimensions of what justice has meant for different communities and organisations. These trajectories spanning the realms of social activism, research, and institutional change have historically called for more than (re)distributional approaches to justice. We argue that recentring procedural, epistemic, and recognition-based notions of justice is critical in addressing the challenges of planetary justice in both research and practice of earth systems governance. Pluralising Planetary Justice ({PPJ}) requires a series of epistemic shifts in the way we research and practice the governance of environmental inequalities. These shifts demand attention to the links and gaps between justice movements and scholarship beyond the industrialised North. They also require scaling debates within climate justice and developmental ethics regarding peoples’ abilities to achieve well-being and the challenges of public deliberation across spatio-temporal scales. Finally, these shifts need to recognise long-lasting processes of epistemic colonialism and integrate intersectional, multispecies, intergenerational, and non-western notions of justice. We argue procedural, epistemic, and recognition-based justice are essential guiding principles and empirical standpoints to developing pluriversal and multiscale human-earth governance systems. Without appealing to procedural, recognition, and epistemic concerns, planetary justice cannot meaningfully engage with the necessary agents and trajectories or outline the normative ends to which it aims to advance in earth systems governance.},

While they are not intended to deal with justice, {IAM} assumptions and structure have justice implications that have not been explicitly discussed or clearly elucidated in critical accounts of modelling practices. Given their key influence in policy decisions and the increasing imperative for just transitions and climate action, a more explicit consideration of the justice dimensions of {IAM}-derived mitigation pathways is necessary. This paper reviews existing critiques to {IAMs} through a three-dimensional justice lens to examine the extent to which justice concerns emerge or remain unnoticed in the literature. This review helps substantiate how disciplinary and geographical assumptions and norms shape policy choices. Focusing mostly on the role of technoeconomic framings and processes of model-based knowledge production, and drawing from critical justice theorists, such as Nancy Fraser, the article shows how dominant approaches to justice have overlooked questions of recognition and their subsuming distributional and participational concerns. It also points to the need to engage with other knowledge systems and approaches through cognitive justice, for a more transformative critique of policy relevant climate knowledge, as well as to strive for more diverse, equitable and inclusive policy options.},

We show that sensitivity auditing, an extension of sensitivity analysis to the entire cycle of model framing and building, is an effective means to scrutinize policy-relevant modelling activities, including forms of quantifications such as metrics, indicators, and rankings. Sensitivity auditing, that is also inspired by the epistemology of post-normal science, calls on modellers to examine the assumptions during model construction and operation, including those relating to the identification of the nature of the problem and of the policy context. In this contribution, we present four real-world applications of sensitivity auditing in public health, education, human–water systems, and food provision systems.},

Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages \& limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs.

Although decision-making tools exist to help assess the appropriateness of conventional sanitation systems in a specific context, there is a lack of a holistic decision-making framework to guide sanitation research, development, and deployment ({RD}\&D) of technologies. In this study, we introduce {DMsan}─an open-source multi-criteria decision analysis Python package that enables users to transparently compare sanitation and resource recovery alternatives and characterize the opportunity space for early-stage technologies. Informed by the methodological choices frequently used in literature, the core structure of {DMsan} includes five criteria (technical, resource recovery, economic, environmental, and social), 28 indicators, criteria weight scenarios, and indicator weight scenarios tailored to 250 countries/territories, all of which can be adapted by end-users. {DMsan} integrates with the open-source Python package {QSDsan} (quantitative sustainable design for sanitation and resource recovery systems) for system design and simulation to calculate quantitative economic (via techno-economic analysis), environmental (via life cycle assessment), and resource recovery indicators under uncertainty. Here, we illustrate the core capabilities of {DMsan} using an existing, conventional sanitation system and two proposed alternative systems for Bwaise, an informal settlement in Kampala, Uganda. The two example use cases are (i) use by implementation decision makers to enhance decision-making transparency and understand the robustness of sanitation choices given uncertain and/or varying stakeholder input and technology ability and (ii) use by technology developers seeking to identify and expand the opportunity space for their technologies. Through these examples, we demonstrate the utility of {DMsan} to evaluate sanitation and resource recovery systems tailored to individual contexts and increase transparency in technology evaluations, {RD}\&D prioritization, and context-specific decision making.},

Such communities often lack the capacity to develop extensive energy concepts and thus to exploit these resources in a consistent way. This paper presents an integrated participatory approach to developing feasible energy concepts for small communities. The novelty lies in the combination of methods, the consideration of uncertainties, and the application to an exemplary municipality in Germany. Stakeholder workshops are combined with energy modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis ({MCDA}), and a high transferability is ensured with mainly public data. The workshop discussion revealed three values: economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and local energy autonomy. A total of eight alternatives for the 2030 energy system are identified to achieve these values. We find that an alternative that seeks only maximization of economic sustainability should be rejected based on elicited preferences. Instead, several alternatives seeking a maximization of environmental sustainability with constraints on economic sustainability (i.e. total cost) and local energy autonomy consistently achieve the highest overall performance scores. A maximization of economic sustainability or local energy autonomy alone results in the lowest overall performance scores and should therefore not be pursued by the community. The intermediate alternatives demonstrate that an equivalent performance gain with respect to autonomy comes at higher costs than the same gain with respect to environmental sustainability. Similarities between the best performing alternatives in terms of technologies that can be installed by 2030 show that our methodology can generate concrete and robust recommendations on building-level measures for energy system design.},

	abstract = {Euclidean distance matrices ({EDM}) are matrices of squared distances between points. The definition is deceivingly simple: thanks to their many useful properties they have found applications in psychometrics, crystallography, machine learning, wireless sensor networks, acoustics, and more. Despite the usefulness of {EDMs}, they seem to be insufficiently known in the signal processing community. Our goal is to rectify this mishap in a concise tutorial. We review the fundamental properties of {EDMs}, such as rank or (non)definiteness. We show how various {EDM} properties can be used to design algorithms for completing and denoising distance data. Along the way, we demonstrate applications to microphone position calibration, ultrasound tomography, room reconstruction from echoes and phase retrieval. By spelling out the essential algorithms, we hope to fast-track the readers in applying {EDMs} to their own problems. Matlab code for all the described algorithms, and to generate the figures in the paper, is available online. Finally, we suggest directions for further research.},

	abstract = {The energy sector continues to undergo substantial structural changes. Currently, the expansion of renewable energy sources and the decentralisation of energy supply lead to new players entering the market who pursue different objectives and have different preferences. Thus, multiple and usually conflicting targets need to be considered. Moreover, recent public reactions towards infrastructure projects highlight the importance of considering public acceptance as a key dimension of decision making in the energy sector. As a result, decision processes grow more complex at all levels from political to strategic, tactical and operational decisions in companies. We therefore present an approach combining power systems analysis considering grid constraints and multi-criteria decision analysis. The approach focusses on multi-dimensional sensitivity analyses allowing for simultaneous variations of the different preference parameters determined within the decision analysis aimed at facilitating preference elicitation and consensus building in group decisions. The focus of the paper is the demonstration of the presented approach for a power generation and transmission planning case study in the context of the energy transition in Germany.},

	abstract = {In recent years, most countries in the Middle East and North Africa ({MENA}), including Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, have rolled out national policies with the goal of decarbonising their economies. Energy policy goals in these countries have been characterised by expanding the deployment of renewable energy technologies in the electricity mix in the medium term (i.e., until 2030). This tacitly signals a transformation of socio-technical systems by 2030 and beyond. Nevertheless, how these policy objectives actually translate into future scenarios that can also take into account a long-term perspective up to 2050 and correspond to local preferences remains largely understudied. This paper aims to fill this gap by identifying the most widely preferred long-term electricity scenarios for Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. During a series of two-day workshops (one in each country), the research team, along with local stakeholders, adopted a participatory approach to develop multiple 2050 electricity scenarios, which enabled electricity pathways to be modelled using Renewable Energy Pathway Simulation System {GIS} ({renpassG}!S). We subsequently used the Analytical Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) within a Multi-Criteria Analysis ({MCA}) to capture local preferences. The empirical findings show that local stakeholders in all three countries preferred electricity scenarios mainly or even exclusively based on renewables. The findings demonstrate a clear preference for renewable energies and show that useful insights can be generated using participatory approaches to energy planning.},

After illustrating these decisions with examples and lessons learned from the community, we conclude that even though individual researchers' choices are important, institutional changes are still also necessary for more openness and transparency in energy research.},

The present review analyzes the different modeling tools available to assess energy systems in smart cities. It creates an updated overview of the modeling tools currently available, showing their capabilities and main potential outputs when considering the energy efficiency objective in the context of smart cities in Europe. A restricted set of 14 tools are identified which optimally fulfill the modeling mission of the energy sector, in a smart city context, for different time horizons. The selection considers the capability to include decarbonization assessments, namely, by considering the flexibility to use different external factors, energy policies, technologies, and mainly the implementation of Article 7 from the Energy Efficiency Directive and the “energy efficiency first” principle defined by the European Commission. The {ELECTRE} {TRI} method was used to implement a multi-criteria decision approach for sorting modeling tools, aiming at distributing the various alternatives by previously defined categories, and considering the performance criteria of each alternative modeling tool, the analysis suggests that the best options are the {LEAP}, {MESSAGEix}, and oemof tools.},

In turn, heterogeneity and randomness of the real-world can be captured that are usually found in large samples of real-world data. This paper presents a methodological framework for an empirical deterministic–stochastic modeling approach to utilize large real-world datasets in long-term energy systems modeling. A new software system—{OSeMOSYS}-{PuLP}—was developed and is available now.It adds the feature of Monte Carlo simulations to the existing open-source energy modeling system (the {OSeMOSYS} modeling framework).

Prior literature recommends meaningful, early community engagement to both improve siting outcomes and empower the public to participate in decision-making, but there is no recent nor comprehensive understanding of industry experiences with engagement. This study provides a critical contribution by revealing the practices and perspectives of project developers. We draw upon a survey of 123 professionals employed at 62 unique companies across the United States. We demonstrate that developers are highly concerned about the impact of community opposition on project deployment, and that they already use a variety of engagement strategies and adjust project designs in response to community feedback. However, the public is generally not made aware of project proposals until after land for the project is secured, and industry expenditures on engagement activities pale in comparison to other project development costs. We draw upon Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation to operationalize the engagement preferences of developers, and find that the majority of developers prefer that members of the public provide input but not recommend or make decisions. We characterize this preference as ‘halfway up the ladder’, compared to the idealized vision of full citizen empowerment envisioned in narratives of just transition. These findings contribute to discussion of the role and potential for community engagement to attend to justice in the energy transition.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle advancements will result in new types of fissile material, including nuclear wastes, that require security and safeguards. Nuclear wastes may be more vulnerable for diversion by non-state actors, and chemical processing to recover fissile material is not an insurmountable challenge. Previous work has applied a figure of merit ({FOM}) to assess material attractiveness and security risks. This analysis applies the material attractiveness {FOM} to wastes produced by fuel cycles from the Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening ({FCES}) study. Two aspects of security risk are studied: (1) the time before the fissile material in the waste becomes attractive and (2) the number of waste packages required to obtain a critical mass of fissile material. Two fuel cycles are presented to highlight detailed results: (1) once-through use of low-enriched U in light water reactors ({LWRs}) and (2) continuous recycle of Pu in sodium fast reactors ({SFRs}). Increasing {LWR} used nuclear fuel ({UNF}) package loading increases the time to attractiveness, but the larger packages contain enough Pu for multiple critical masses. The high-level waste ({HLW}) from processing the {SFR} fuels has similar {FOM} behavior but longer time to attractiveness due to the concentration of fission products. More {HLW} packages are required to obtain a critical mass; that number can be further increased by increasing the separation efficiency. Extended to all {FCES} fuel cycles, the minimum time before attractiveness is generally lower for {UNF} than for {HLW} because radioactivity is concentrated in {HLW}. For nearly all fuel cycles that produce {UNF}, only one package is required to recover enough fissile material for a critical mass. Notably, some advanced fuel cycles produce {HLW}, of which only two packages need to be recovered to obtain a critical mass, even when the target fissile material is recycled. Going forward, an assessment of the security risks posed by fissile material in nuclear wastes will need to quantify the challenge posed by separations. Ultimately, the assessment could inform security and response measures; whether any of the observations might affect these measures could be an area for future work. Finally, future analysis could study whether different fuel cycle wastes are more attractive for use in radiological dispersal devices or radiological exposure devices.},

Data obtained from case studies of two recent natural disasters in the U.S. are utilized to explore the status quo, key players and interactions, and the drivers to and barriers of improving resilience in transportation infrastructure systems. The findings indicate that strategies for enhancing resilience in transportation infrastructure systems include redistributing the available funding through a special funding vehicle, using resilience-based performance measures, and integrating the efforts of different stakeholders. The {SoS} approach along with the findings from the case studies provides an analytical tool for understanding the dynamics of resilience in infrastructure systems. Such understanding could lead to identifying strategies for enhancing resilience in infrastructure systems.

Resilience, in the form of supplying a small amount of power to homes and communities, can mitigate outage consequences by sustaining critical electricity-dependent services. Public decisions about investing in resilience depend, in part, on how much residential customers value those critical services. Here we develop a method to estimate residential willingness-to-pay for back-up electricity services in the event of a large 10-day blackout during very cold winter weather, and then survey a sample of 483 residential customers across northeast {USA} using that method. Respondents were willing to pay {US}\$1.7–2.3 {kWh}–1 to sustain private demands and {US}\$19–29 day–1 to support their communities.

	abstract = {Urban areas constitute over three-fourths of the current global economy, house more than half of the global population and consume more than two thirds of final global energy consumption with the consequential greenhouse gas emissions. New dynamics are occurring with cities becoming vectors of sustainable development, through initiatives like the Covenant of Mayors. Innovative approaches and tools are required to support city development planning in compliance with climate change mitigation goals. City planning and management are typically addressed through a fragmented and silo approach, failing to capture the dynamics and complexity of a city energy system. Integrated energy system modelling tools are progressively incorporating increasing realism to enhance results quality and confidence. This paper demonstrates the effects of including household budget constraints in integrated energy system optimisation modelling on low carbon city pathways. The {TIMES}\_EVORA model was used to characterize current and future city energy system, covering all its chain, from energy supply sectors (e.g. electricity production) to end use sectors (e.g. residential and transport). Optimal solutions for meeting Évora municipality (Portugal) 2030 greenhouse gases emissions targets were assessed, combining household budget constraints for the acquisition of more efficient technologies – from appliances to private vehicles. The results showed a decrease of hybrid vehicles ownership in 2030 and a consequent increase of diesel vehicles. The optimal model solution shows a persistence in the acquisition of highly efficient households' appliances and the deployment of additional {PV} systems to facilitate a reduction of the electricity generation {CO}2 footprint. This allows to offset the transport {CO}2 emission increase and provide benefits across all energy system. Improving the integration of behavioural or real-life aspects in energy system optimisation models allows further understanding of city energy systems dynamics and provide robust city decarbonization strategies design. Cities sustainable energy system and urban planning should include different agent's investment constraints in order to avoid technology deployment locking that can compromise cities sustainable pathways.},

Municipalities engage in the transition to renewable energy systems through the formulation of strategies and goals at a local level despite often lacking appropriate tools and resources to conduct the needed complex analyses. Tools for energy system analyses have traditionally been designed either with the scope of national energy systems or detailed project-specific analysis in mind, leaving municipal planners in a state of flux. This study aims to identify important specifications and critical design principles for future energy system modelling tools designed for municipal planners. Through a qualitative case-oriented approach, this study investigates the planning practices of four municipalities. It is found that future tools for municipal planning purposes need to combine the need for systematic analyses with concrete and implementable initiatives while balancing analytical complexity with operational simplicity.},

The studies are assessed with respect to the characteristics of their methodology and applications, in order to derive common trends and insights. Most case studies apply to middle-income countries and only focus on the supply of electricity in the residential sector. Furthermore, many of the studies are comparable regarding objectives and applied methods. Local energy autonomy is associated with high costs, leading to levelized costs of electricity of 0.41 \$/{kWh} on average. By analysing the studies, many improvements for future studies could be identified: the studies lack an analysis of the impact of autonomous energy systems on surrounding energy systems. In addition, the robust design of autonomous energy systems requires higher time resolutions and extreme conditions.

The empirical data for this study is based on insights generated through expert interviews (N =19) with mayors, energy experts and scientists as well as a quantitative study among mayors and energy officers (N =109) of German municipalities. Results show that environmental awareness, tax revenues and greater independence from private utilities are positively related to the mayors’ attitude towards the realization of energy self-sufficiency. Furthermore, citizens, the political environment, the mayor's political power, and his/her financial resources are relevant factors for a municipality striving for energy self-sufficiency. Policymakers need to decide whether or not to support mayors in this development. For suitable policy interventions, the results suggest the importance of an integrated approach that considers a combination of identified factors.

	abstract = {This paper presents a model for municipal power planning, incorporating renewable power generation sources and energy storage facilities. It proposes a prototyping model architecture including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and battery power storage, linked to the municipal power demands and interacting with the power grid. The planning model minimises the total system cost, comparing the pure monetary cost minimisation and accounting for the eco-cost related to the Greenhouse Gas and Water Footprints. The provided case study illustrates the economic feasibility of renewables integration, accounting for the eco-cost, maximising the use of photovoltaic panels. Adding the eco-cost minimises the footprints further and achieves a simultaneous reduction of total cost and footprints by approximately 25\% and 39\%. The sensitivity of the cost and footprints towards the life span of batteries was found marginal – compensated by increased power export to the grid, while the eventual life span reduction of wind turbines exerts a significant influence on the system performance in terms of cost and footprints – up to 40\% compared to the base case. The sensitivity to the land availability for {PV} panels has also been found significant, obtaining cumulative reductions of the cost and footprints of 39\% for cost and 50\% from the benchmark case. The proposed method lays the foundation for a comprehensive energy planning method for municipalities to further include the social pillar of sustainability.},

	abstract = {The elements of societal risk from a nuclear power plant accident are clearly illustrated by the Fukushima accident: land contamination, long-term relocation of large numbers of people, loss of productive farm area, loss of industrial production, and significant loss of electric capacity. {NUREG}-1150 and other studies have provided compelling evidence that the individual health risk of nuclear power plant accidents is effectively negligible relative to other comparable risks, even for people living in close proximity to a plant. The objective of this study is to compare the societal risk of nuclear power plant accidents to that of other events to which the public is exposed. We have characterized the monetized societal risk in the United States from major societally disruptive events, such as hurricanes, in the form of a complementary cumulative distribution function. These risks are compared with nuclear power plant risks, based on {NUREG}-1150 analyses and new {MACCS} code calculations to account for differences in source terms determined in the more recent {SOARCA} study. A candidate quantitative societal objective is discussed for potential adoption by the {NRC}. The results are also interpreted with regard to the acceptability of nuclear power as a major source of future energy supply.},

	abstract = {This study sheds new light on nuclear risk governance from a sociological perspective by analyzing cases of post-Fukushima controversies on nuclear safety and nuclear emergency preparedness in Japan. By critically analyzing how the three risk-related concepts and methodologies, namely, probabilistic risk assessment, safety goals, and the System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, have been interpreted, implemented, and/or abandoned before and after the Fukushima accident, this study identifies three common features that characterize Japan’s nuclear risk governance: avoiding critical conflicts, proclivity toward automated decision making, and strategic overlooking of “uncomfortable knowledge.” These features all involve ignorance of the dynamic nature of safety where addressing uncertainties, heterogeneous knowledge, and incommensurable values can be key for continuously reviewing the existing edifice of safety. By elucidating why such ignorance persists in Japan despite the post-accidental drastic reform, the authors both articulate the deep-rooted structure that underlies it and reflects the societal and historical context, and eventually conceptualize this ignorance as “structural ignorance” of expertise in nuclear safety controversies and policy processes. The results also provide direction for further research to solve this structural problem.},

In particular, the social cost of introducing measures to protect power-distribution systems from power-source instability and the cost of accident-risk response for various power sources must be investigated. To account for these risk factors, an integrated societal risk assessment framework, based on power-uncertainty analysis and accident-consequence analysis, is proposed. In this study, we applied the proposed framework to nuclear power plants, solar photovoltaic systems, and wind-turbine generators. The required capacity of gas-turbine power plants to be used as backup power facilities to compensate for fluctuations in the power output from the main power source was estimated based on the performance indicators of each power source. The average individual health risk per terawatt-hours ({TWh}) of electricity produced by each power source was quantitatively estimated by assessing accident frequency and the consequences of specific accident scenarios based on the probabilistic risk assessment methodology. This study is expected to provide insight into integrated societal risk analysis, and can be used to estimate the social cost of various power sources.},

	abstract = {We perform a statistical study of risk in nuclear energy systems. This study provides and analyzes a data set that is twice the size of the previous best data set on nuclear incidents and accidents, comparing three measures of severity: the industry standard International Nuclear Event Scale, the Nuclear Accident Magnitude Scale of radiation release, and cost in U.S. dollars. The rate of nuclear accidents with cost above 20 {MM} 2013 {USD}, per reactor per year, has decreased from the 1970s until the present time. Along the way, the rate dropped significantly after Chernobyl (April 1986) and is expected to be roughly stable around a level of 0.003, suggesting an average of just over one event per year across the current global fleet. The distribution of costs appears to have changed following the Three Mile Island major accident (March 1979). The median cost became approximately 3.5 times smaller, but an extremely heavy tail emerged, being well described by a Pareto distribution with parameter α = 0.5–0.6. For instance, the cost of the two largest events, Chernobyl and Fukushima (March 2011), is equal to nearly five times the sum of the 173 other events. We also document a significant runaway disaster regime in both radiation release and cost data, which we associate with the “dragon-king” phenomenon. Since the major accident at Fukushima (March 2011) occurred recently, we are unable to quantify an impact of the industry response to this disaster. Excluding such improvements, in terms of costs, our range of models suggests that there is presently a 50\% chance that (i) a Fukushima event (or larger) occurs every 60–150 years, and (ii) that a Three Mile Island event (or larger) occurs every 10–20 years. Further—even assuming that it is no longer possible to suffer an event more costly than Chernobyl or Fukushima—the expected annual cost and its standard error bracket the cost of a new plant. This highlights the importance of improvements not only immediately following Fukushima, but also deeper improvements to effectively exclude the possibility of “dragon-king” disasters. Finally, we find that the International Nuclear Event Scale ({INES}) is inconsistent in terms of both cost and radiation released. To be consistent with cost data, the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters would need to have between an {INES} level of 10 and 11, rather than the maximum of 7.},

	abstract = {Doubts of whether the risks related to severe accidents in nuclear reactors are indeed
very low were raised after the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi in 2011 Risk
estimations of severe accidents in nuclear power plants involve both probability and
consequence assessment of such events Among the ways to display risks, risk curves
are tools that express the frequency of exceeding a certain magnitude of consequence
Societal risk is often represented graphically in a {FN}-curve, a type of risk curve,
which displays the probability of having N or more fatalities per year, as a function
of N, on a double logarithmic scale The {FN}-curve, originally introduced for the assessment
of the risks in the nuclear industry through the {USNRC} Reactor Safety Study {WASH}-1400
(1975), is used in various countries to express and limit risks of hazardous activities
This first study estimated an expected rate of core damage equal to 5x10"-"5 by reactor-year
and suggested an upper bound of 3x10"-"4 by reactor-year A more recent report issued
by Electric Power Research Institute - {EPRI} (2008) estimates a figure of the order
of 2x10"-"5 by reactor-year The Fukushima nuclear accident apparently implies that
the observed core damage frequency is higher than that predicted by these probabilistic
safety assessments Therefore, this paper presents a preliminary analyses of the {FN}-curves
related to severe nuclear reactor accidents, taking into account a combination of
available data of past accidents, probability modelling to estimate frequencies, and
expert judgments (author)},

	abstract = {The {IAEA} has repeatedly recommended that the nuclear community should arrive at a common understanding and definition of safety goals for severe accidents in nuclear power plants. The recommendation has only found partial answers, despite the numerous working groups and forums devoted to this effort. The most widely accepted definition of goals is based on the concept of Large (Early) Release Frequencies (L(E){RF}) and its derivatives, a surrogate concept derived from results of Probabilistic Safety Assessments ({PSAs}) which was first introduced in the {USA} almost twenty years ago and much later accepted by the {USNRC} for risk informed decision making, but not for safety demonstrations. Other types of Safety Goals have been adopted by some nuclear authorities, but the main drawback of all current definitions is that they may apply only to {LWRs}. The lack of unifying safety/risk parameter throughout of {PSAs} worldwide is the basis of the present work, and an attempt is made to arrive at the definition of a Risk Target for severe accidents in {NPPs}, consistent with the {IAEA} definitions having a technical basis, which can be adopted without modifications for Generation {IV} power plants. The proposal of Common Risk Target in this work represents an attempt to define a Common Risk Target based on technical reasoning, reflecting {IAEA} definitions as well as harmonization requirements raised by the whole European Community in various {OECD}, {ASAMPSA}2 and {SARNET} (Guentay et al., 2006) conclusions and Council Directive of The European Union (Community Framework, 2009) as well as lastly performed stress tests of nuclear power plants throughout the Europe (Peer Review Report, 2012). The basic concept of {CRT} was first introduced and developed within the European project {ASAMPSA}2 by the authors of this article and was accepted by majority of world {PSA} experts participating in final evaluation and survey of the project (Guentay, 2011). In the proposed Risk Target concept an innovative original idea is used to join {PSA} L2 analyses with {IAEA} {INES} scale expressed in I131 equivalent transformed to consequences. The {INES} scale became the basis for further considerations as it is currently used for evaluation of degree of severity of real accidents. Since {PSA} deals with potential accidents which might become real with some probability (therefore {PSAs} are performed indeed), the {INES} scale seems to be a good tool – commonly and widely accepted for real accidents – to evaluate the degree of severity of potential accidents and thus to be used for the risk limit/target definition for nuclear accidents.},

In doing so, the previous understanding of what constitutes “optimisation” and “simulation” is expanded with further distinctions and it is documented how the outlined modelling approaches are applied in the existing literature. In a practical comparison, it is tested how the choice of modelling approach influences the design of future energy system scenarios for a municipal case study. The energy system scenarios and results obtained from a proposed stepwise simulation approach are compared to an established multi-objective optimisation approach. The results show that for the investigated municipal case it is possible to obtain results with a simulation-based approach that are comparable to the results obtained from multi-objective optimisation. Ultimately, the choice of modelling approach is a complex issue in which modellers must consider the necessary degree of modelling freedom, stakeholder involvement, and available system knowledge. Modellers need to consider not only what tool to use, but also how it is used; a tool can be used for both optimisation and simulation, and both can be valid approaches for developing future energy system scenarios.},

	abstract = {Energy system models can contribute to the transition to low-carbon energy systems by helping devise pathways and calculate costs of energy policies and targets. As such, they are intended to provide support for energy planning, especially at the national level. Since energy system models are often developed outside urban contexts, their municipal policy relevance cannot be taken for granted. It is still unclear to what extent and how energy system models are applied to create municipal energy strategies and who uses them. This exploratory study aims to shed light on these aspects by examining the use of modelling tools and their outputs by municipal planners. We conducted interviews with practitioners from Danish municipalities and evaluated them using qualitative content analysis. This paper finds that the interviewees' use of software tools depends on how they perceive the functionality and complicatedness of the tools. The planners we interviewed prefer spreadsheet-based {CO}2 calculation or evaluation tools to energy system models, which in turn are used by heat supply companies, consultancies or universities. The practitioners we interviewed collaborate with model developers and users to further utilize model outputs. The incorporation of results from models or spreadsheet tools takes place mostly in the beginning of energy planning projects. This study suggests that models and the modelling practice can be improved with: open data, assumptions and models, collaboration across planning levels and improving links between technical modelling and practical implementation.},

Across 8,871 neighbourhoods in 196 {US} urban areas, we observed a stepwise correlation between risk grade, number of power plants and cumulative quantity of power plant emissions upwind and within 5 km. Controlling for pre-existing power plants, neighbourhoods deemed ‘hazardous’ (D grade, ‘red-lined’) had a higher likelihood of a fossil fuel power plant being sited between 1940 and 1969 (72\%), 1970 and 1999 (20\%) and 2000 and 2019 (31\%), and higher average present-day emissions of nitrous oxides (82\%), sulfur dioxide (38\%) and fine particulate matter (63\%) compared with ‘declining’ (C-graded) neighbourhoods.

However, real-world energy systems often deviate from deterministic scenarios, necessitating rigorous uncertainty exploration in macro-energy system modeling. This study uses modeling techniques to generate diverse near cost-optimal net-zero {CO}2 pathways for the United States’ energy system. Our findings reveal consistent trends across these pathways, including rapid expansion of solar and wind power generation, substantial petroleum use reductions, near elimination of coal combustion, and increased end-use electrification. We also observe varying deployment levels for natural gas, hydrogen, direct air capture of {CO}2, and synthetic fuels. Notably, carbon-captured coal and synthetic fuels exhibit high adoption rates but only in select decarbonization pathways. By analyzing technology adoption correlations, we uncover interconnected technologies. These results demonstrate that diverse pathways for decarbonization exist at comparable system-level costs and provide insights into technology portfolios that enable near cost-optimal net-zero {CO}2 futures.},

	abstract = {Transitioning to a clean energy economy will require expanded energy infrastructure. An
equitable, or just, transition further requires the recognition of the people and communities
directly affected by this transition. However, public preferences may be ignored during decision making processes related to energy infrastructure due to a lack of technical rigor or expertise
(Johnson et al., 2021). This challenge is further complicated by the fact that people have
and express preferences over many dimensions simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization
offers a method to help decision makers and stakeholders understand the problem and analyze
tradeoffs among solutions (Liebman, 1976). Although, to date, no open-source multi-objective
energy modeling frameworks exist. Open-source multi-objective energy system framework
(osier) is a Python package for designing and optimizing energy systems across an arbitrary
number of dimensions. osier was designed to help localized communities articulate their
energy preferences in a technical manner without requiring extensive technical expertise. In
order to facilitate more robust tradeoff analysis, osier generates a set of solutions, called a
Pareto front, that are composed of a number of technology portfolios. The Pareto front is
calculated using multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms. osier also extends
the common modeling-to-generate-alternatives ({MGA}) algorithm into N-dimensional objective
space, as opposed to the conventional single-objective {MGA}. This allows users to investigate
the near-optimal space for appealing alternative solutions. In this way, osier may aid modelers
in addressing procedural and recognition justice.},

Impressive advances in computer and data sciences have allowed for a multitude of complex energy system optimization models. In our manuscript, we assess the hypothesis of a positive correlation between complexity of a model and accuracy of its results. For this, we propose a framework based on alternative model formulations and apply it in a case study with 160 different, more or less complex, implementations of power system optimization models for dispatch and investment. Our results indicate that a certain degree of complexity is indeed necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate results. However, a careful balancing is also necessary for acceptable use of computational resources. In terms of partial load efficiency of conversion processes, our findings indicate that (two) different formulations should be used for dispatch and for investment decisions. Furthermore, a model including simple grid constraints comes with only minor increases in complexity compared to a model assuming a copper plate. Moreover, the combination of multiple technical constraints for conversion processes leads to a significant gain in accuracy while the combination of multiple time-coupling constraints is a major complexity driver.},

	abstract = {Solar power, also known as solar electricity, is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics ({PV}) or indirectly using concentrated solar power. Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.
Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop {PV} system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar panels has fallen, grid-connected solar {PV} systems' capacity and production has doubled about every three years. Three-quarters of new generation capacity is solar, with both millions of rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continuing to be built.
In 2023, solar generated 5\% of the world's electricity, compared to 1\% in 2015, when the Paris Agreement to limit climate change was signed. Along with onshore wind, in most countries, the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations is utility-scale solar.Almost half the solar power installed in 2022 was rooftop. Much more low-carbon power is needed for electrification and to limit climate change. The International Energy Agency said in 2022 that more effort was needed for grid integration and the mitigation of policy, regulation and financing challenges.},

This is accompanied by the demand for high result reproducibility in order to provide transparency to decision-makers in terms of assumptions and methodological issues. Given this background, Open Access Models ({OAMs}) are increasingly entering the market that already have a high degree of diversity. This study analyses and compares the methodological framework of different {OAMs} to assess long-term energy scenarios. In a first step, selected {OAMs} are typified and characterised based on predefined criteria. In general, the analysis reveals that {OAMs} with a high level of accessibility appear to have a rather low level of complexity and often focus on the analysis of a single target year. In a second step, we underline our findings of the model overview by applying a well-established {OAM} ({DESSTinEE} - Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in {EuropE}) to a current energy scenario for Germany. Overall, we conclude that current {OAMs} can already be applied to a large variety of research questions. However, comparing {OAMs} to conventional models applied in the field of energy system analysis reveals that there is still a significant performance gap in terms of the degree of methodological sophistication.},

	abstract = {Given the urgent need to devise credible, deep strategies for carbon neutrality, approaches for ‘modelling to generate alternatives’ ({MGA}) are gaining popularity in the energy sector. Yet, {MGA} faces limitations when applied to state-of-the-art energy system models: the number of alternatives that can be generated is virtually infinite; no realistic computational effort can discover the complete technology and spatial option space. Here, based on our own {SPORES} method, a highly customisable and spatially-explicit advancement of {MGA}, we empirically test different search strategies – including some adapted from other {MGA} approaches – with the aim of identifying how to minimise redundant computation. With application to a model of the European power system, we show that, for a fixed number of generated alternatives, there is a clear trade-off in making use of the available computational power to unveil technology versus spatial dissimilarity across alternative system configurations. Moreover, we show that focussing on technology dissimilarity may fail to identify system configurations that appeal to real-world stakeholders, such as those in which capacity is more spread out at the local scale. Based on this evidence that no feasible alternative can be deemed redundant a priori, we propose to initially search for options in a way that balances spatial and technology dissimilarity; this can be achieved by combining the strengths of two different strategies. The resulting solution space can then be refined based on the feedback of stakeholders. More generally, we propose the adoption of ad-hoc {MGA} sensitivity analyses, targeted at testing a study’s central claims, as a computationally inexpensive standard to improve the quality of energy modelling analyses.},

	abstract = {Energy system models are challenged by the need for high temporal and spatial resolutions in order to appropriately depict the increasing share of intermittent renewable energy sources, storage technologies, and the growing interconnectivity across energy sectors. This study compares different temporal aggregation strategies, which reduce the number of considered time steps, to maintain computational viability of these models. The work focuses on the representation of time series by a subset of single time steps (i.e., typical time steps), or by groups of consecutive time steps (i.e., typical periods), which are commonly applied in the literature using clustering. We test these techniques for two different energy system models and benchmark the optimization results based on aggregation to those of the fully resolved models. Further, centroids and medoids are used to represent the clustered datasets and it is investigated whether the optimal aggregation method can be determined based on clustering indicators only. The results reveal that typical time steps consistently outperform typical periods with respect to clustering indicators, but do not lead to more accurate optimization results when applied to a model that takes numerous storage technologies into account. Although both aggregation techniques are capable of coupling the aggregated time steps, typical periods offer more options to depict storage operations, whereas typical time steps are more effective for models that neglect time-linking constraints. Further, this observation is independent from the choice of centroids or medoids to represent the clustered time series. In summary, the adequate choice of aggregation methods strongly depends on the mathematical structure of the considered energy system optimization model, and a priori decisions of a sufficient temporal aggregation are only possible with good knowledge of the mathematical structure of the underlying optimization problem.},

Clustering algorithms support the improvement of the models' scalability and performance. The methods developed in this work gives stakeholders the tool to calculate the capabilities and restrictions of the local energy system. The models are applied to a case study using data from an Austrian city, Linz. Four scenarios help to understand aspects of the energy community, such as the lock-in effect of existing infrastructure and future developments. The results show that it is possible to reduce both objectives, but the solutions for minimum costs and minimum carbon emissions are contrary to each other. This work quantifies the highest effect of emission reduction by the electrification of the system.

Communities are considered as key arenas of transforming policies into actions, where technical configurations intersect with socioeconomic interests. Local governments put great efforts into developing and applying energy strategies. Although many frontrunner projects are well-documented, insufficient attention is paid to the average-performing municipalities that are challenged in linking technical energy scenarios with socioeconomic realities. The following implementation gap between national policy and local practice leads to a non-attainment of national energy targets. This paper analyses the Strategic Energy Plans ({SEP}) of 17 Danish municipalities based on their development, scope, and inclusion of local communities. As a synopsis, the main technical, physical, organizational and socioeconomic challenges for local energy policy implementation were illustrated. Internal organization, lacking municipal capacities, combined with the complexity of communities leads to procedural deficits in strategy production. The resulting neglect of socioeconomics and other community peculiarities by technology-driven strategies impede strategy implementation. As a consequence, a community-oriented taxonomy of implementation challenges is introduced. This approach might help to improve the scope of {SEPs}, ensure a local anchoring of energy strategies, and raise awareness for challenges already present during strategy production to facilitate strategy implementation.},

	abstract = {Energy systems are becoming increasingly complex as developments such as sector coupling and decentral electricity generation increase their interconnectedness. At the same time, energy system models that are implemented to depict and predict energy systems are limited in their complexity due to computational constraints. Thus, a trade-off has to be made between high degrees of detail and model runtimes. As a first step towards efficiently managing the complexity of energy system models, we examine the relationship between the purpose of models and their complexity. Using fact sheets on 145 models, we manually cluster these models based on their purpose and underlying research questions. Further, we conduct mathematical clustering using several clustering methods to investigate the reproducibility of our results. For our study, we define the complexity of a model as the level of detail in which it represents reality. We distinguish the level of detail into the four dimensions of temporal, spatial, mathematical and modeling content complexity. The differences between the clusters found in these dimensions are verified statistically using confidence intervals. 112 out of 145 models can be allocated to one out of four major clusters possessing clearly distinguishable complexity profiles: unit commitment, electrical grids, policy assessment, and future energy systems. In each of these profiles, high complexity in one dimension or subdimension is compensated by low complexities in other dimensions. We therefore conclude that when creating a model, modelers allocate complexity in order of priority on those features and properties that are particularly important for fulfilling the model's purpose. Our results provide a necessary basis for the emerging field of complexity management in energy system modeling and are therefore of high interest for the scientific community and the interpreters of model results such as decision makers from policy and industry.},

A vast range of energy system modelling tools is available, providing modelling practitioners, planners, and decision-makers with multiple alternatives to represent the energy system according to different technical and methodological considerations. To better understand this landscape, here we identify current trends in the field of energy system modelling. First, we survey previous review studies, identifying their distinct focus areas and review methodologies. Second, we gather information about 54 energy system modelling tools directly from model developers and users. Unlike previous questionnaire-based studies solely focusing on technical descriptions, we include application aspects of the modelling tools, such as perceived policy-relevance, user accessibility, and model linkages. We find that, to assess the possible applications and to build a common understanding of the capabilities of these modelling tools, it is necessary to engage in dialogue with developers and users. We identify three main trends of increasing modelling of cross-sectoral synergies, growing focus on open access, and improved temporal detail to deal with planning future scenarios with high levels of variable renewable energy sources. However, key challenges remain in terms of representing high resolution energy demand in all sectors, understanding how tools are coupled together, openness and accessibility, and the level of engagement between tool developers and policy/decision-makers.},

This paper explores why these gaps exist in the public sector using the results of interviews with 20 federal, state, and city government agencies that have used the Renewable Energy Integration and Optimization ({REopt}™) model to inform energy decisions. We then propose adaptations to technical modeling capabilities, and communication of results, which may help increase clean energy deployment. This research may be useful to both analytical modelers and the organizations using such decision tools to inform policy, regulation, planning, and deployment of clean energy systems.},

	abstract = {Energy system models are important tools to guide our understanding of current and future carbon dioxide emissions as well as to inform strategies for emissions reduction. These models offer a vital evidence base that increasingly underpins energy and climate policies in many countries. In light of this important role in policy formation, there is growing interest in, and demands for, energy modellers to integrate more diverse perspectives on possible and preferred futures into the modelling process. The main purpose of this is to ensure that the resultant policy decisions are both fairer and better reflect people's concerns and preferences. However, while there has been a focus in the literature on efforts to bring societal dimensions into modelling tools, there remains a limited number of examples of well-structured participatory energy systems modelling processes and no available how-to guidance. This paper addresses this gap by providing good practice guidance for integrating stakeholder and public involvement in energy systems modelling based on the reflections of a diverse range of experts from this emergent field. The framework outlined in this paper offers multiple entry points for modellers to incorporate participatory elements either throughout the process or in individual stages. Recognising the messiness of both fields (energy systems modelling and participatory research), the good practice principles are not comprehensive or set in stone, but rather pose important questions to steer this process. Finally, the reflections on key issues provide a summary of the crucial challenges and important areas for future research in this critical field.},

Energy communities enable consumers to jointly pursue their individual and collective economic, environmental and social goals, while simultaneously contributing to the decarbonisation of the energy system. Considering the growing interest in this field, this paper aims to enhance the understanding of the social arrangements, the technical designs and the impacts of energy communities. The social arrangements of energy communities are discussed in relation to the different actors, their roles and interactions. Then, the paper reviews the technical aspects of designing various local energy systems, while taking into account the goals of energy community members and outside actors. The reviewed literature is benchmarked with respect to the methods, modelling objectives and the constraints used in the design process. Finally, the paper quantifies the economic, environmental, technical and social impacts of energy communities, reviews the numerical indicators used to quantify these impacts and provides a critical discussion of the findings.

Although major advances have been made in modelling over recent decades, several unresolved implementation issues remain in practice. This paper provides the results of a panel survey, which explored what planners and modellers believe to be key modelling implementation issues, their perceived importance and a set of modelling requirements. The results suggest that planners generally feel that they do not understand models and the modelling process, and modellers, in turn, feel that they do not always understand policy development and decision-making. Problems regarding data preparation were viewed as the most important challenge. Ensuring leadership and management support and initiatives aimed at improving the communication and confidence of participants were perceived as key requirements. Limited resources, leadership support and a lack of education are some of the challenges that are perceived as important before planners and other government officers can take advantage of modelling.},

Firstly, the relevant policy questions the decision makers want answered were revealed in the course of the Forum process. Secondly, the extent to which the existing models can provide meaningful answers to these questions was explored. In the end, it was established that neither of the two existing models is well suited to representing uncertainties or finding robust strategies under deep uncertainty. As models depicting a radical system change over the next 50–100 years must necessarily deal with deep uncertainties, new research methodologies are needed to improve adaptive policy making.},

While energy system models have been useful policymaking tools towards achieving the first two objectives, it is yet unclear to what extent they can also support a just transition. Here, we review 73 recent energy systems modelling studies using an analytical coding frame and observe a diversity of approaches to account for energy justice. While models do show promise in being able to support a just transition, especially in terms of assessing distributional outcomes, many of the approaches in the literature are poorly connected to current energy justice goals and discourses, decreasing the studies’ policy relevance and leaving policymakers with suboptimal planning support. Based on our results, we suggest eight actions for modellers to increase the policy relevance of their studies, which include more direct engagement with policy and research discourses, developing location-specific case studies, leveraging public participation in the modelling process, and considering asset decommissioning.},

Given the increasing effects of climate change on both the frequency and the severity of extreme weather events, energy systems must adapt to cope with this new and evolving risk environment. In this perspective, we argue that re/insurers have an interest in supporting resilient infrastructure as well as the know-how to do so. Specifically, insurers can support resilient infrastructure by offering resilient-oriented insurance products, such as parametric insurance. Integrating resilience into re/insurance requires integrating existing assessment methods, including risk assessment, to develop innovative insurance products that help clients cope with climate change. Developing insurance products alongside industrial, academic, and government partners is key to making both effective and cost-attractive policies. While our argument is tailored towards energy infrastructure and climate change-related threats, resilience-based insurance would also be useful in mitigating the losses caused by other extreme and hybrid threats across interdependent critical infrastructure networks.},

In this perspective, we review 58 model-based publications that explicitly refer to {CoC} and observe that simply stating unfounded assumptions remains the most important “method” for determining the {CoC}. Overall, there appears to be a clear lack of guiding principles for how to appropriately determine {CoC} for use within models. To close this gap, we identify four barriers to a more accurate {CoC} reflection and suggest practical steps for overcoming them, including heuristic guidelines to support modelers in determining when differentiated {CoC} rates ought to be applied.

	abstract = {Key to the necessary decarbonization of energy systems is the large-scale expansion of renewable energy sources and their integration into the electricity system. This integration is challenging because the feed-in from renewable energy sources is highly intermittent and largely dependent on uncontrollable factors such as weather patterns. To maintain grid stability, which refers to the required balance between demand and supply in the electricity system, flexibility is key. Large flexibility potentials can be found on the electricity demand side. However, current electricity market design in Europe, while providing major flexibility incentives, often neglects small-scale electricity consumers and distributed energy resources. We contribute to shape future electricity markets with consumers at the heart by developing six design principles for a consumer-centric electricity market design. We proceed by conducting a systematic literature review and evaluate the findings by expert interviews. Based on the developed design principles, we define a consumer-centric electricity market design as a set of market rules that align with the rules of other relevant energy markets and allow for the efficient matching of electricity demand and supply, with consumers having nondiscriminatory market access, being exposed to fine-grained price signals, being able to express their preferences, and having sufficient possibilities to protect themselves against unexpected price spikes. By actively incorporating consumers into electricity markets, we contribute to the overarching goal of integrating renewable energy sources while promoting energy justice, i.e., supporting a balanced mix of economic, political, environmental, and social interests.},

Due to the high computational expenses of these models, only individual case studies are usually examined. In this article, the approach from the author’s {PhD} thesis to transfer the optimisation results from individual case studies to many other energy systems is summarised. In the first step, a typology of the energy systems to be investigated was created. Based on this typology, representative energy systems were selected and analysed in an energy system optimisation model. In the third step, the results of the representative case studies were transferred to all other energy systems. This approach was applied to a case study for determining the minimum costs of energy system transformation for all 11,131 German municipalities from 2015 to 2035 in the completely energy autonomous case. While a technical potential to achieve energy autonomy is present in 56\% of the German municipalities, energy autonomy shows only low economic potential under current energy-political conditions. However, energy system costs in the autonomous case can be greatly reduced by the installation and operation of base-load technologies like deep-geothermal plants combined with district heating networks. The developed approach can be applied to any type of energy system and should help decision makers, policy makers and researchers to estimate optimal results for a variety of energy systems using practical computational expenses.},

	abstract = {Optimization-based modelling provides valuable guidance for designing integrated urban energy systems. However, modelers have to make certain assumptions and they may lack awareness of realistic conditions such as decision-makers’ preferences on certain technology, which can easily lead the obtained optimal solution to be invalid. Therefore, instead of focusing on one “fragile” optimal solution, this paper provides a systematic overview of the contribution each technology can bring to the whole system design so as to achieve the optimum. To achieve this, a portfolio constraint based approach is proposed, which is inspired by the modelling to generate alternatives ({MGA}) method as well as the eps-constraint method for multi-objective optimization. By varying the threshold values of portfolio constraints, a series of solutions can be gathered as an “impact space” representing the economic and environmental contributions of each technology for the whole system design. A practical Fitting of Ellipses method is further applied to quantify the size of the impact space. Through observing the formation of the impact space, more valuable insights on system design can be obtained. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of an urban district in Shanghai, China, where a generalized urban energy system model involving commonly used energy supply technologies is established. Various technologies and design options lead to significantly different impact spaces, where {CHP} is found to have the largest impact on system design. Overall, instead of merely providing decision-maker a very specific solution, this paper introduces a new approach to evaluate multiple technologies when designing integrated urban energy systems.},

	abstract = {Multi-criteria decision analysis ({MCDA}) involves asking decision makers difficult questions, and can leave them thinking that their judgements are not as coherent as they might have thought. This experience can be distressing and may even lead to rejection of the analysis. The psychology of preference sheds light both on how people naturally make choices without decision analytic assistance, and on how people think about the {MCDA} elicitation questions. As such, it can help the analyst to respond helpfully to difficulties which decision makers may face. In this paper, we review research from Behavioural Decision Theory relevant to {MCDA}. Our review follows the {MCDA} process, discussing research relevant to the structuring, value elicitation, and weighting phases of the analysis, outlining relevant and important findings, and open questions for research and practice.},

In recent years, such models have been criticised for being overly techno-centred and ignoring environmental and social factors of the energy transition. Here, we explore and illustrate the impact of ignoring such factors by comparing model results to model user needs and real-world observations. We firstly identify concrete user needs for better representation of environmental and social factors in energy modelling via interviews, a survey and a workshop. Secondly, we explore and illustrate the effects of omitting non-techno-economic factors in modelling by contrasting policy-targeted scenarios with reality in four {EU} case study examples. We show that by neglecting environmental and social factors, models risk generating overly optimistic and potentially misleading results, for example by suggesting transition speeds far exceeding any speeds observed, or pathways facing hard-to-overcome resource constraints. As such, modelled energy transition pathways that ignore such factors may be neither desirable nor feasible from an environmental and social perspective, and scenarios may be irrelevant in practice. Finally, we discuss a sample of recent energy modelling innovations and call for continued and increased efforts for improved approaches that better represent environmental and social factors in energy modelling and increase the relevance of energy models for informing policymaking.},

It draws on a compiled database of fifty-nine studies at a local, regional, and national level detailing analysis on full energy systems down to sectors, modes, and single technologies. The initial aim of the paper is to consolidate and present this growing body of literature, providing a clear understanding of which stakeholder groups have been engaged and what methods have been used to link stakeholder engagement with quantitative analysis. On from this, the progress to date in democratising key decision-making processes is discussed, reflecting on the benefits and challenges of a participatory approach, as well as highlighting gaps within the current body of literature. During the review, two differing spatial levels at subnational (cities, municipalities, or regions) and national scale emerged as separate groups for analysis. A clear distinction between the two groups was the motivation for involving stakeholders. At a subnational level, researchers hoping to build local capacity to bring about real-world change engaged with community representatives, whereas national level studies concerned with generating more impactful energy policy measures involved industry, policymaking, and academic experts. One key finding from the review was that only ten out of the fifty-nine studies reviewed noted some form of collaboration with non-academic stakeholders, and moreover 36\% of studies involved just a single interaction with participants. This indicates a lack of progress to date in process democratisation within energy system modelling and planning research.},

	abstract = {Universal electrification by 2030 is an important goal of Sustainable Development Goal ({SDG}) 7. Electricity provision no longer relies only on centralized grid expansion, but also on off-grid and mini-grid systems. Although this technological diversity holds promise, the technologies differ both physically and institutionally in electricity delivery. These differences raise equity and justice concerns around how they are implemented. For example, how can electricity be kept affordable for all consumers when access is provided by various technologies operated under different business models? This paper addresses this aspect of affordability and sheds light on how the {SDG}7 target could be met more equitably and fairly. We use a novel analytical methodology to apply two different principles of justice – equality and equity – to incorporate affordability into electricity pricing. Using a geospatial electrification model and Tanzania as a case study, we first arrive at price levels based on the principle(s) of justice. Then, we produce location-specific recommendations for subsidy levels needed to ensure those price levels. We find that the equity approach benefits a bigger section of the population than the equality approach. Moreover, the former costs significantly less per capita than the latter. Having said that, the equity approach is complex and therefore harder to implement. The methodological framework proposed in this study acts as a proof-of-concept for examining concerns around distributive justice using quantitative energy modelling tools and drawing policy relevant insights for energy planning in developing countries. Additionally, by focusing on the spatial aspects of energy access and the issue of fairness, the study also contributes to the growing conceptualizations of energy justice.},

	abstract = {While electricity access is lowest in developing countries, the academic literature on generation expansion planning ({GEP}) has been informed almost exclusively by challenges in industrialised countries. This paper presents the first multi-objective, long-term energy planning optimisation model tailored towards national power systems with little existing power infrastructure. It determines the location, type, capacity and timing of power system infrastructure additions. Specifically, three novel generalisations of standard generation planning are introduced: (1) an expansion of the demand constraints to allow for industrial and household electrification rates below 100\%, (2) a minimisation of sub-national energy access inequality in conjunction with minimising system costs considering environmental constraints, and (3) an integration of distribution infrastructure, explicitly including both on-grid and off-grid electrification. Using a specifically designed solution algorithm based on the ε-constraint method, the model was successfully applied to the previously unexplored Ugandan national power system case. The results suggest that while it is cost-optimal to maintain highly unequal sub-national access patterns to meet Uganda’s official 80\% electrification target in 2040, equal access rates across all districts can be achieved by increasing discounted system cost by only 3\%. High optimal shares of locationally flexible on-grid and off-grid solar energy enable cheap sub-national shifts of generation capapcity. This paper strongly challenges the Ugandan government’s nuclear energy and largely grid-based electrification expansion plans. Instead, it calls for solar concentrated power as a baseload option in the future and a focus on off-grid electrification which the model selects for the majority of household connections in 2040, even in a high-demand scenario.},

Such models mainly focus on techno-economic aspects and do not adequately represent the social aspects of the energy transition, although there is broad consensus that these non-technical factors are important drivers and constraints. To map the current integration and identify perspectives for future research, we ask: Which model types are particularly good at integrating social aspects? What social aspects are represented in energy models? How are these social aspects integrated? We analysed publications that apply these energy models to investigate which and how models integrate social aspects within three main modelling steps: (i) storyline, scenario, and input parameter, (ii) optimisation/simulation process and (iii) model output discussion. Results show that social aspects are mainly integrated through exogenous assumptions and output discussions. We also identify models that go beyond technical potential and pure cost optimisation/simulation. All model types integrate behaviour and lifestyle; some address public acceptance, but not transformation dynamics. Only agent-based models integrate heterogeneity of actors and public ownership. We conclude that a better representation of social aspects in energy models is needed, and that there is a high potential to improve this by combining different model types and conducting interdisciplinary research.},

The past performance of such projections has been systematically overconfident. Analysts have often used scenarios based on detailed story lines that spell out “plausible alternative futures” as a central tool for evaluating uncertainty. No probabilities are typically assigned to such scenarios. We argue that this practice is often ineffective. Rather than expanding people’s judgment about the range of uncertainty about the future, scenario-based analysis is more likely to lead to systematic overconfidence, to an underestimate of the range of possible future outcomes. We review relevant findings from the literature on human judgment under uncertainty and discuss their relevance to the task of making probabilistic projections. The more detail that one adds to the story line of a scenario, the more probable it will appear to most people, and the greater the difficulty they likely will have in imagining other, equally or more likely, ways in which the same outcome could be reached. We suggest that scenario based approaches make analysts particularly prone to such cognitive biases, and then outline a strategy by which improved projections, tailored to the needs of specific decision makers, might be developed.},

Methods have been designed for mapping carbon emissions, such as input–output models, spatial systems, geographic information system maps, light detection and ranging techniques, and logarithmic mean divisia. We present decarbonization technologies and initiatives, and negative emissions technologies, and we discuss carbon trading and carbon tax. We propose plans for carbon neutrality such as shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy, and the development of low-carbon technologies, low-carbon agriculture, changing dietary habits and increasing the value of food and agricultural waste. Developing resilient buildings and cities, introducing decentralized energy systems, and the electrification of the transportation sector is also necessary.

In this study we offer a novel approach for evaluating agroforestry systems from the farmer perspective. The approach couples rapid rural appraisal and normative optimisation techniques to determine favourable land-use compositions for meeting various socio-economic and ecological goals, based on farmers’ empirical knowledge and preferences. We test our approach among smallholder farmers in Eastern Panama, obtaining data from household interviews and using hierarchical cluster analysis to identify farm groups with similar land-use and income characteristics. We found that moderate differences in farmers’ perceptions between these groups altered the type and share of agroforestry included in the optimised land-use portfolios that balance the achievement of 10 pre-selected socio-economic and ecological objectives. Such differences provide valuable information about potential acceptability of agroforestry within each group. For example, we found that farmers who derive most of their farm income from crops may be more willing to adopt silvopasture, whereas farmers who are more economically dependent on cattle may benefit from diversifying their land-use with alley cropping. We discuss the potential of this modelling approach for participatory land-use planning, especially when dealing with small sample sizes and uncertainty in datasets.},

While there are several reviews focusing on the comparison of models based on their technical characteristics and features, to the authors’ knowledge, no review article exists on comparison techniques based on final results. The scope of this paper is to carry out a review of existing methods and techniques to compare energy system frameworks, models, and scenario results regarding their final results.},

In this review, we overview the historical and modern definitions of energy equity and frameworks of energy justice. We highlight the tools adopted to measure equity in the energy context, unveiling multifaceted inequities that permeate global energy landscapes. We discuss the limitations of prevalent metrics such as the Gini coefficient and Generalized Entropy Indices in the evaluation of energy justice concerns. Finally, we analyze publications that examined current practices and proposed improving methods towards a more equitable energy market for the society from policy, planning, and operation perspectives.},

	abstract = {We present a novel rank-based fully multiple-criteria implementation of the Sobol′ variance-based sensitivity analysis approach that implements an objective strategy to evaluate parameter sensitivity when model evaluation involves several metrics of performance. The method is superior to single-criterion approaches while avoiding the subjectivity observed in “pseudo” multiple-criteria methods. Further, it contributes to our understanding of structural characteristics of a model and simplifies parameter estimation by identifying insensitive parameters that can be fixed to default values during model calibration studies. We illustrate the approach by applying it to the problem of identifying the most influential parameters in the Simple Biosphere 3 ({SiB}3) model using a network of flux towers in Brazil. We find 27–31 (out of 42) parameters to be influential, most (∼78\%) of which are primarily associated with physiology, soil, and carbon properties, and that uncertainties in the physiological properties of the model contribute most to total model uncertainty in regard to energy and carbon fluxes. We also find that the second most important model component contributing to the total output uncertainty varies according to the flux analyzed; whereas morphological properties play an important role in sensible heat flux, soil properties are important for latent heat flux, and carbon properties (mainly associated with the soil respiration submodel) are important for carbon flux (as expected). These distinct sensitivities emphasize the need to account for the multioutput nature of land surface models during sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation. Applied to other similar models, our approach can help to establish which soil-plant-atmosphere processes matter most in land surface models of Amazonia and thereby aid in the design of field campaigns to characterize and measure the associated parameters. The approach can also be used with other sensitivity analysis procedures that compute at least two model performance metrics.},

It is distinct from uncertainty analysis, which addresses the question ‘How uncertain is the prediction?’ Uncertainty analysis needs to map what a model does when selected input assumptions and parameters are left free to vary over their range of existence, and this is equally true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, many uncertainty and sensitivity analyses still explore the input space moving along one-dimensional corridors leaving space of the input factors mostly unexplored. Our extensive systematic literature review shows that many highly cited papers (42\% in the present analysis) fail the elementary requirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results, while discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and recognized good practices. We end by exploring possible reasons for this problem, and suggest some guidelines for proper use of the methods.},

Distributed Energy Systems ({DESs}) are being widely investigated, since they are expected to be largely used to increase the efficiency of energy supply and to address environmental problems. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimized operation strategies of a {DES}, to reduce both energy costs and environmental impacts. The {DES} includes different energy conversion devices and thermal energy storage systems to satisfy time-varying user demands. The Pareto front, including the best possible trade-offs between the economic and the environmental objectives, is obtained by minimizing a weighted sum of the total energy costs and {CO}2 emissions. The operators of {DESs} can choose the operation strategy from the Pareto front based on the economic and environmental priorities. The method is implemented for a {DES} with a large-scale utility customer as end-user. Results show that the optimized operation of the {DES} reduces energy costs and {CO}2 emissions, as compared with conventional energy supply systems. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to analyze the effects on energy costs and environmental impacts of variations in the configuration of the {DES}.},

The promising energy, environmental and economic advantages of these systems are greatly dependent on their design and operational strategy. Consequently, methods and guidelines for the optimal design and operation of such systems, also taking into consideration their life cycle, are needed to fully exploit their potential. This paper proposes a general methodology for the simultaneous optimization of the design and operation of multi-generation energy systems by considering life cycle energy and economic assessment. The design optimization problem is solved by means of surrogate modeling and the operation optimization problem by means of dynamic programming. The multi-generation energy system considered in this paper comprises renewable energy systems, fossil fuel energy systems and energy storage technologies. Different multi-objective optimizations were performed by considering the minimization of fossil cumulative energy demand, and total investment and operational costs. The validity of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by using the campus of the University of Parma (Italy) as a case study. Compared to a conventional plant, the optimal solution allows a life cycle energy saving of about 17\% and total cost reduction of about 18\%. Moreover, compared to an optimization method based on particle swarm optimization and dynamic programming, the proposed methodology provides comparable results, but the computation time is 78\% lower. The proposed methodology outperforms commonly used optimization algorithms and provides an effective and flexible framework for the optimal design and operation of multi-generation energy systems.},

A regional integrated energy system ({RIES}) involves coupling use of multiple energy sources, which can improve energy efficiency using multi-energy complementarity. However, increasingly renewable energies and multi-energy sources load access into an energy system increase the multiple uncertainties of {RIES}, which has considerable impact on both system planning and operation. This study proposes a multi-objective stochastic planning method that is based on the multi-dimensional correlation scenario set generation method for {RIES}’ expansion planning. The scenario generation method considers the characteristics, time sequence, autocorrelation, and cross-correlation of renewable energies and multi-energy loads. The pipeline risk index for energy network expansion planning is defined considering the energy pipeline’s importance. A multi-objective stochastic planning model based on chance constraints of the energy network is developed to minimize the investment cost and the energy pipeline risk. Finally, to confirm the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed model and method, certain numerical cases at Yangzhong City, China, are simulated. Two {RIES} expansion planning scenarios are then compared. Moreover, the Pareto fronts of the optimized expansion planning schemes are demonstrated, providing reference for balancing the energy network planning scheme economy and the energy pipeline risk.},

However, input parameters are in general uncertain. If uncertainties are disregarded in the optimization, solutions usually become infeasible in practice. To incorporate uncertain parameters, we apply the concept of minmax robust multi-objective optimization for designing sustainable energy supply systems. We propose a mixed-integer linear problem formulation. The proposed formulation allows to identify robust sustainable designs easily guaranteeing security of energy supply. Energy systems are shown to typically exhibit objective-wise uncertainties. Thus, a Pareto front can still be derived. In a real-world case study, robust designs are identified with a good trade-off between economic and ecologic criteria. The robust designs perform remarkably well in the nominal scenario. The presented problem formulation transfers the important theoretical concept of minmax robust multi-objective optimization into engineering practice for the design of sustainable energy systems.},

	abstract = {Developing robust policies for complex systems is a profound challenge because of their nonlinear and unpredictable nature. Dealing with these characteristics requires innovative approaches. A possible approach is to design policies that can be adapted over time in response to how the future unfolds. An essential part of adaptive policymaking is specifying under what conditions, and in which way, to adapt the policy. The performance of an adaptive policy is critically dependent on this: if the policy is adapted too late or too early, significant deterioration in policy performance can be incurred. An additional complicating factor is that in almost any policy problem, a multiplicity of divergent and potentially conflicting objectives has to be considered. In this paper we tackle both problems simultaneously through the use of multi-objective robust simulation optimization. Robust optimization helps in specifying appropriate conditions for adapting a policy, by identifying conditions that produce satisfactory results across a large ensemble of scenarios. Multi-objective optimization helps in identifying such conditions for a set of criteria, and providing insights into the tradeoffs between these criteria. Simulation is used for evaluating policy performance. This approach results in the identification of multiple alternative conditions under which to adapt a policy, rather than a single set of conditions. This creates the possibility of an informed policy debate on trade-offs. The approach is illustrated through a case study on designing a robust policy for supporting the transition toward renewable energy systems in the European Union. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be efficiently used for developing policy suggestions and for improving decision support for policymakers. By extension, it is possible to apply this methodology in dynamically complex and deeply uncertain systems such as public health, financial systems, transportation, and housing.},

	abstract = {Energy transitions are complex transformation processes, which involve different actors and unfold in a deeply uncertain future. These features make the long-term planning of energy transitions a wicked problem. Traditional strategic planning approaches fail to address this wickedness as they have a predictive, deterministic, and reactive standpoint to future issues. Modelling approaches that are used within conventional contexts are perceived to be inadequate too. They often simplify the qualitative characteristics of transitions and cannot cope with deeply uncertain futures. More recently, new ways of qualitative participatory planning, as well as new approaches to quantitative modelling have emerged to enable policy analysis under deep uncertainty. We argue that qualitative participatory and quantitative modelling approaches can be complementary to each other in different ways. We operationalise their coupling in the form of a practical approach to be used for long-term planning of energy transitions. The suggested approach enables energy decision makers to test various policy interventions under numerous possibilities with a computational model and in a participatory process. We explain our approach with illustrative examples mostly from transitions in electricity sectors. However, our approach is applicable to different forms of energy transitions, and to the broader context of transition in any societal system, such as water and transportation.},

In its original inception, the search phase identifies optimal strategies for a single reference scenario for deep uncertainties, which may result in missing locally near-optimal, but globally more robust strategies. Recent work has addressed this issue by generating candidate strategies for multiple policy-relevant scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate a systematic scenario selection procedure in the search phase to consider both policy relevance and scenario diversity. The results demonstrate an increased tradeoff variety besides higher robustness, compared to the solutions found for a reference scenario. Future research can routinize multi-scenario search in {MORDM} with the aid of software packages.},

The experiments investigate the impact of model type (optimization vs. simulation), planning horizon (intertemporal vs. myopic), temporal resolution (8760 vs. 384 h), and spatial resolution (28 countries vs. 12 mega-regions). The model type fundamentally determines the evolution of capacity expansion. Planning horizon (assumed foresight of firms) plays a minor role for scenarios with high carbon prices. For low carbon prices in turn, results from myopic models deviate considerably from those of intertemporal models. Lower temporal and spatial resolutions foster wind power via storage and via neglected transmission boundaries, respectively. Using simulation instead of optimization frameworks, a shorter planning horizon of firms, or lower temporal and spatial resolutions might be necessary to reduce the computational complexity. This paper delivers recommendations on how to limit the discrepancies in such cases.},

	abstract = {Low-income households generally experience a high energy burden; however, the factors influencing energy burdens are beyond socio-economics. This study explores the relationships between the multidimensionality of community vulnerability factors and energy burden across multiple geospatial levels in the United States. Our study found the distribution of energy burden in 2020 showed a great deal of variety, ranging from a minimum of 2.93 \% to a maximum of 30.45 \% across 3142 counties. The results of non-spatial and spatial regressions showed that the vulnerability ranks of socioeconomic, household composition and disability, minority and language, household type and transportation, and {COVID} mortality rate are significant predictors of energy burdens at the national level. However, at the regional level, only socioeconomic, minority and language significantly influence energy burdens. Minority and language negatively impact energy burdens except for the South East-Central region. Additionally, our analyses highlight the need to consider community vulnerability indicators' spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity. At the national level, only the epidemiological factors index is a spatially homogeneous predictor; on the regional and state level, the spatially homogeneous predictors such as socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, and household type and transportation vary by region. Such a region-sensitive relationship between energy burden and the predictors indicates spatial heterogeneity. This study suggests policy recommendations through the lens of the multidimensionality of community vulnerability factors. Implementing flexible national energy policies while making particular energy assistance policies for the vulnerable population at the regional or state levels is essential.},

To impact decision-making, scenarios do not have to be accurate — but credible and evoke coherent expectations in diverse stakeholders. To gain credibility, authors of scenarios engage with stakeholders and appeal to the authority of institutions or quantitative methods. From these insights on energy scenarios, we draw consequences for developing and applying planning models, the quantitative tool energy scenarios build on. Planning models should be open and accessible to facilitate stakeholder participation, avoid needlessly complex methods to minimize expert bias and aim for a large scope to be policy relevant. Rather than trying to simulate social preferences and convictions within engineering models, scenario development should pursue broad and active participation of all stakeholders, including citizens.},

Therefore, we investigate the gap between model improvements relevant from the perspective of modellers compared to what users of model results think models should address. Thus, we ask: What are the differences between energy model improvements as perceived by modellers, and the actual needs of users of model results? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review, 32 interviews, and an online survey. Our results show that user needs and ongoing improvements of energy system models align to a large degree so that future models are indeed likely to be better than current models. We also find mismatches between the needs of modellers and users, especially in the modelling of social, behavioural and political aspects, the trade-off between model complexity and understandability, and the ways that model results should be communicated. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of user needs and closer cooperation between modellers and users is imperative to truly improve models and unlock their full potential to support the transition towards climate neutrality in Europe.},

Based on a survey of 103 civil society groups conducted in 2021, this paper investigates how groups mobilize technical projects and expert knowledge to overcome these barriers. We frame these mobilizations as expressions of civic technoscience, and argue their pivotal role in building capacity for effective engagements with pipelines. To this extent, we furthermore suggest that civic technoscience is fundamental to building civic infrastructures for reforming participatory governance gaps. We conclude with recommendations for how civic technoscience can better support the intentions of civic infrastructuring by coordinating activities across coalitions, as well as by shifting the scales at which groups engage with the governance of pipelines.},

With this, after a scientific review, we selected 17 tools targeted on an urban/districts scale that can evaluate several energy services, sources and/or technologies, and provided with detailed and easily accessible documentation. These tools were classified based on their defined features: analysis type, operation spatial scale, outputs time scale, energy service, and licence. Among them, 6 user-friendly tools were identified ({energyPRO}, {HOMER}, {iHOGA}, {EnergyPLAN}, {SIREN}, {WebOpt}) that can provide hourly energy calculations and can be considered as viable for widespread use. Specifically, the general information, functionalities, structure, graphic user interface, required input data, and outputs were described.

Multi-carrier {EH}-based {IESs} available in the literature have reached a desirable level of maturity for broad scales. However, there is confusion in the literature that misleads readers regarding multi-carrier {EH}-based {IESs} located on limited scales (e.g., buildings or neighborhood level). Furthermore, multi-carrier {EH}-based {IESs} studies that involve complexities such as discrete, continuous, or mixed decision-making variables, multiple conflicting objective functions, non-linearity, non-convexity, and discontinuity are affected by different techno-economic, environmental, and social parameters that are uncertain. Ignoring such uncertain input parameters ({UIPs}) in these studies leads to less adaptable results to realistic conditions. However, their integration is a challenging process intensifying these complexities during studies' modeling, optimization, and decision-making processes. Therefore, this review paper aims to fill these gaps by identifying, classifying, assessing, and prioritizing different {UIPs}, their analyzing techniques, and solution approaches, solvers, and software for addressing relevant optimization problems to achieve a deeper understanding of current challenges and potential future research, trend, and capacities in multi-carrier {EH}-based {IESs} studies.},

First, we identify a managerial literature on how innovation and diffusion can be accelerated, which focuses on deliberation with consensus-oriented ambitions. Second, is a set of perspectives that highlights unevenness, and therefore seeks to radically expand climate and energy democracy by promoting new forms of participatory practices. There are few contact points between these literatures. We argue that this can be explained by tensions and paradoxes that accompany accelerated transitions. These paradoxes cannot easily be resolved. We discuss how accelerated social and technological change poses challenges to inclusive and participatory transitions. Further, we discuss how rapid transitions tends to contribute to conflicts between core and peripheral sites. Thus, transitions are not only affected by societal conditions, but also contribute to co-producing social order, including the many forms of social turmoil currently experienced. Such insight places greater responsibilities on transition scholars, especially from reflexive disciplines such as {STS} and geography. We conclude by discussing how this responsibility could translate into situating climate and energy transition scholarship in broader debates about future socio-technical orders, and sketch three principles of responsible acceleration: a) Moving towards a broad epistemic basis for producing and assessing transition policies and strategies, b) Nurturing polycentrism for rapid climate and energy transitions, and c) Developing polytemporal strategies for transition.},

However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, {ESOMs} tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for {ESOMs}. We have identiﬁed four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to {ESOM} type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights.

	abstract = {The energy system is undergoing a transition driven by the need of achieving the energy trilemma objectives: decarbonisation, acceptability and security. Energy systems integration connecting the power, gas, heat and transport systems, is one possible pathway to drive the transition flexibly and cost-effectively. Nevertheless, more quantified evidence on the performance of future integrated energy systems towards achieving policy objectives is still needed for decision makers to support this route. This paper first identifies the expected changes to the energy system upon integration, including new interactions and interdependencies between its components and actors. The paper then argues the need for a whole energy systems approach for the evaluation of integrated energy systems, represented by six characteristics: multidimensional, multivectoral, systemic, futuristic, systematic, and applicability. Based on the identified characteristics, the paper reviews existing evaluation frameworks for energy systems sustainability, and qualitatively appraises their adequacy for evaluating future integrated energy systems. The review concludes that existing frameworks are not capable of assessing the performance of integrated energy systems, lacking one or more of the characteristics. The paper finally presents a novel holistic evaluation framework based on the System-of-Systems approach for systems analysis coupled with an indicator-based approach for evaluation. The proposed framework demonstrates the six characteristics as it enables evaluation with respect to multiple perspectives and objectives at different system levels. Moreover, this framework captures future changes to the whole energy system architecture and highlights the interdependencies between energy systems. This framework can also be systematically applied to various scenarios in different contexts.},

	abstract = {Access to reliable and sustainable electricity is still precluded for a large share of global population living in rural areas of developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Hybrid microgrids are considered a suitable solution for providing affordable and reliable access to electricity to isolated communities. Properly planning and sizing such systems is although an aspect that can greatly influence the sustainability of the intervention, and the arrival to the market of the third generation minigrids poses new challenges to the process. Three main challenges are identified as pivotal for the proper sizing of new generation microgrids: arrival of the main grid, inappropriateness of Net Present Cost as only objective function in the strategy selection process, and necessity to operate on already existing minigrids. Such aspects are addressed in this work by proposing a methodological advancement to an existing open-source microgrid sizing model: a grid outage model alongside the definition of new constraints and variables for the optimization problem with grid-connected microgrids, a multi-objective optimization option, and a brown-field optimization option. The new version of the model is tested on real life case studies in rural Rwanda (greenfield) and Mozambique (brownfield), proving the profitability of grid-connected and grid-extension solutions for sufficiently low connection distances. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess variations in system size, cost and {CO}2 emissions with respect to microgrid and grid connection parameters.},

	abstract = {Distributed Multi-Energy Systems (D-{MES}) can sustainably transform the energy supply of buildings, districts, and communities by integrating multiple energy efficient technologies, renewable energy sources, and electricity, gas, and thermal energy networks to provide heating, cooling and electricity services. However, D-{MES} typically exhibit high levels of technical complexity and encompass various economic, environmental, and policy-related aspects. Consequently, energy models are needed to optimally design and operate D-{MES} and to analyze their performance in detail. A multitude of aspects must be considered when developing a D-{MES} model. A first aspect, for instance, is whether an optimization or a simulation approach is more appropriate for the model's scope. Moreover, it is important to accurately represent all the relevant technical characteristics and performance constraints of the various energy generation, storage and distribution network technologies in the model. Additionally, in many cases, adopting approaches from other domains like urban and building energy simulation might be required to identify building requirements for heating, cooling, and electricity. Additional aspects, such as the uncertainty of a model's parameters, which complicates D-{MES} design and operation decisions, or the computational burdens imposed by extending these models towards the whole-city scale also need to be considered. Finally, methods that can bridge models that focus on specific sub-dimensions of D-{MES} and allow for more holistic D-{MES} modeling need to be developed. This paper aims to address these key challenges and to outline recent developments in the field of modeling of D-{MES} by answering ten questions about the most relevant D-{MES} modeling dimensions.},

	abstract = {Recent studies indicate that the effects of inter-annual climate-based variability in power system planning are significant and that long samples of demand \& weather data (spanning multiple decades) should be considered. At the same time, modelling renewable generation such as solar and wind requires high temporal resolution to capture fluctuations in output levels. In many realistic power system models, using long samples at high temporal resolution is computationally unfeasible. This paper introduces a novel subsampling approach, referred to as importance subsampling, allowing the use of multiple decades of demand \& weather data in power system planning models at reduced computational cost. The methodology can be applied in a wide class of optimisation-based power system simulations. A test case is performed on a model of the United Kingdom created using the open-source modelling framework Calliope and 36 years of hourly demand and wind data. Standard data reduction approaches such as using individual years or clustering into representative days lead to significant errors in estimates of optimal system design. Furthermore, the resultant power systems lead to supply capacity shortages, raising questions of generation capacity adequacy. In contrast, importance subsampling leads to accurate estimates of optimal system design at greatly reduced computational cost, with resultant power systems able to meet demand across all 36 years of demand \& weather scenarios.},

	abstract = {The interdependence of electricity and natural gas markets is becoming a major topic in energy research. Integrated energy models are used to assist decision-making for businesses and policymakers addressing challenges of energy transition and climate change. The analysis of complex energy systems requires large-scale models, which are based on extensive databases, intertemporal dynamics and a multitude of decision variables. Integrating such energy system models results in increased system complexity. This complexity poses a challenge for energy modellers to address multiple uncertainties that affect both markets. Stochastic optimisation approaches enable an adequate consideration of uncertainties in investment and operation planning; however, stochastic modelling of integrated large-scale energy systems further scales the level of complexity. In this paper, we combine integrated and stochastic optimisation problems and parametrise our model for European electricity and gas markets. We analyse and compare the impact of uncertain input parameters, such as gas and electricity demand, renewable energy capacities and fuel and {CO}2 prices, on the quality of the solution obtained in the integrated optimisation problem. Our results quantify the value of encoding uncertainty as a part of a model. While the methodological contribution should be of interest for energy modellers, our findings are relevant for industry experts and stakeholders with an empirical interest in the European energy system.},

Thus, the coupling between power and gas networks is becoming more critical. New complementarities arise from the synergies of the co-optimization of both power and natural gas systems operation in terms of reliability, sustainability, and economic efficiency. In this regard, jointly planning of power and natural gas systems could leverage potential benefits for the optimal coordination of both grids. In this survey, we present a comprehensive investigation of recent literature in the contexts of coordinated planning of the gas and electricity systems. We first provide a thorough study of energy systems planning. Later, the planning issues of both power and gas grids are investigated, including modeling aspects, typical operational constraints, and objectives that drive investments, as well as uncertainties associated. Then, international experiences are presented to compare the mathematical approaches to the planning of electricity and natural grids.

In this context, residential-size, photovoltaic-based multi-carrier energy systems using hydrogen as seasonal storage are analyzed as a possible solution to gain energy autarky. A high temporal (15 min) and long-term (10 a) power flow simulation approach is applied to a multi-objective optimization algorithm to minimize costs and grid energy feed-out. Approximate pareto-optimal system configurations are analyzed regarding system sizing, energy autarky, and economic performance for three residential building types and four European locations. Building type and location strongly influence the techno-economic feasibility of approximate pareto-optimal system configurations. Low-Energy-Houses are technically and economically most feasible to reach autarky, while Single-Family and Multi-Family-Houses show available {PV} energy as main restricting factor, which becomes especially problematic at high latitude locations. Under current economic constraints, no cost-competitive autarky system could be identified. Low Energy Houses show the lowest additional cost of 172\% compared to a Base system at the low-seasonality location, but cost-competitiveness is possible under certain cost projections within a time horizon of 2030–2035. The developed energy system model is open-source and can be used for future research in this context.},

Life cycle assessments are broadly used to account for environmental aspects, however, this traditional approach may fall short of designing truly sustainable alternatives. Here, we review the concept of absolute sustainability and how it can be incorporated into energy systems modeling and optimization. Besides providing background, guidance, and perspective, we also discuss some challenges related to environmental and computational aspects.

	abstract = {The transition from energy systems based on fossil fuels and toward those based on renewable resources is very necessary for sustainable development. Evaluation of the current sustainability level is known to be the first step toward sustainability improvements. With the use of multi-expert multi-criteria decision making and interval type-2 fuzzy sets, this research suggests a novel method for determining the current degree of sustainability through renewable energy systems based on distance to ideal solution concept. The presented approach draws attention to components that are underperforming, which assists decision-makers in recognizing the barriers to sustainable growth. A numerical example that illustrates the use of the proposed approach in renewable energy systems demonstrates the implementation methods and benefits of the strategy. The results of the sustainability performance evaluation indicate three individual dimensions of sustainability indicators for social, economic, and environmental aspects, as well as an overall sustainability indicator which is calculated as ((2.91, 4.70, 4.70, 6.47; 1.00, 1.00), (3.85, 4.70, 4.70, 5.60; 0.90, 0.90)) and according to its distance to ideal solution value 5.297 corresponds to “weakly sustainable” for the illustrative case. Also, the underperforming criteria can be determined, which for our case study are filling station availability, {NOx} emissions, need for waste disposal, land requirements, and social acceptability. The proposed methodology has the potential to facilitate the development of more effective policies and strategies for sustainable development on a global scale. This can be accomplished by enhancing the quality of linguistic judgments made by experts and by providing a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability of renewable energy systems worldwide.},

In municipalities with high scenicness, it is likely that onshore wind will be rejected, leading to higher levelized costs of energy by up to about 7 €-cent/{kWh}. Onshore wind would be replaced mainly by solar photovoltaics and imports, and the cost-optimal energy systems would be associated with higher {CO}2 emissions of up to about 200 {gCO}2/{kWh} compared with an average of around 50 {gCO}2/{kWh}. The findings help to identify municipalities where public resistance to onshore wind could be particularly high and support the scientific and policy debate about the location of onshore wind farms.},

However, in practice, aggregated costs are the decisive criterion. Thus, in a second step, the solution space of the synthesis problem is restricted to an acceptable deviation from minimal aggregated costs. Thereby, only relevant solutions are obtained. The two steps significantly reduce the effort for multi-objective optimization focusing on the most relevant part of the solutions. The proposed method is applied to a real-world case study.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a thorough review of 75 modelling tools currently used for analysing energy and electricity systems. Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

The paper emphasizes the need for collaborative governance and additionality, highlighting sustainable energy as a critical component for a more resilient future. Using purposefully selected fifty renewable energy projects in the United States, the paper conducts a case study analysis using software-aided two-cycle coding to analyze 110 reports, articles, and government documents from the past ten years. The study reveals how the additionality of renewables is often ignored in policymaking due to vocal opposition from the public, resulting in negative governance. Through the lens of additionality and collaborative governance, the paper contributes to the existing research on sustainable energy policies in three ways. First, it unpacks the understudied concepts of negative governance and hyper-engaged citizenry and their respective roles in policymaking. Second, it proposes practical recommendations for academia, policymakers, and the general public to promote the collaboration and additionality of renewable energy. Third, it offers valuable empirical details on the manifestation of additionality perspectives in the governance of sustainable energy projects and their implementations. The paper's findings emphasize the importance of a collaborative and informed approach to sustainable energy policymaking for building a more resilient future.},

	abstract = {Today only an exclusive group of citizens is represented in most energy transition projects. Adoption patterns are substantially shaped by gender, ethnic identity, education level, income and wealth. This stands in contradiction to the principle of fostering inclusive engagement as a key goal of energy transition policy. Despite notable exceptions, research is lacking on developing strategies for supporting demographically inclusive energy transitions. This action research study contributes to this gap by developing a theory-based and empirically tested approach for supporting inclusive engagement in energy transitions. For this purpose, we follow-up on a promising line of research in psychology and societal transformation, to inform a transition experiment aiming at fostering inclusivity based on the social-psychological concept of identity. In particular, we build on the common ingroup identity model ({CIIM}). The {CIIM} describes an approach to uniting people with different identities under a common umbrella identity, with the goal of uniting previously separated and in some cases divided groups. As such, we propose that the {CIIM} holds potential for connecting actors with different backgrounds in jointly shaping energy transitions. To investigate this here we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of an energy transition experiment structured around the {CIIM}. The findings of a mixed methods-evaluation study suggest that there is indeed potential in this approach, for fostering inclusivity. We comment on the implications for energy policy and on some of the challenges of action research in energy transitions contexts.},

Participants read a scenario in which they were asked to put themselves in the position of a resident in a town near which a project developer planned to implement a {CCUS} or onshore wind project. Depending on the experimental condition, participants read that they, as local residents, could voice their opinion and that their input was considered (genuine voice) or was not considered (pseudo voice) by the developer, or that they could not voice their opinion (no voice). As predicted, giving local residents a genuine voice opportunity resulted in higher project acceptance compared to giving a pseudo voice or no voice opportunity, due to an increase in perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. Results further showed that giving a pseudo voice opportunity can be equally detrimental as giving no voice opportunity at all. The findings underline the importance of genuine voice opportunities and show that policymakers and project developers should avoid voice opportunities where residents' input is seemingly ignored.},

In response, regional and localized entities have taken matters into their own hands to promote expedited progress. Over 200 communities in the United States (states, counties, cities, and townships) have made public pledges to achieve a 100 \% renewable energy (or electricity) transition. However, there is still uncertainty in how the operational, technological, managerial, and infrastructural transitions will occur – and despite growing support for energy transitions, there are still significant gaps in the plans set forth. Within this study, the available information from 186 entities that have made a pledge towards 100 \% renewable energy was synthesized to illustrate where there are gaps in energy transition plans. At the highest level of available data, only 40 \% of communities had a public facing action plan for their transition goals. This metric alone suggests (alongside additional results) that there are significant shortcomings in the existing plans for energy transitions even at the community scale. This calls for reconsidering communication strategies and broadening participation when these transition plans are being discussed, as well as a reassessment of what policy tools are in place to encourage and support these transitions.},

In this study, we explore the possibility for such conversations through participatory monitoring practices around energy technology, using geoengineering projects as an example. Despite being central to the attention of local communities, these projects can be conceptually distant and inaccessible because of their subsurface location. This presents a challenge for engaging experts with non-experts. We elaborate the emerging concept of epistemic justice (defined as fair treatment and equal access to knowledge for all stakeholders) and especially one of its dimensions: hermeneutical justice (that emphasizes the need for institutions to respond to the voices of all stakeholders without any prejudices), as preconditions for democratizing energy production. By applying Q-methodology we analyze the attitudes of 22 experts from Poland toward non-experts' participation in common monitoring activities around geo-engineering projects. We identify three types of narratives: “pro-expert”, “pro-partnership”, and “pro-informative” and argue that experts may be uncertain about their responsibility to engage non-experts in energy projects. Through this study, we encourage experts and knowledge producers to reflect critically on their responsibility to engage non-experts in energy projects and implement democratic procedures more efficiently, including future participatory procedures, thus paving the way for energy democracy to thrive.},

	abstract = {This paper analytically works towards foregrounding a new concept which can be useful to describe local reception and perceptions related to energy transition projects: Why in my backyard ({WIMBY}). We define this concept as local indifference to take part in changes in local energy landscapes at the community level. Based on the reception and data from two pilot and demonstration projects in Arctic Norway we show how locals passively accept, or reluctantly support green measures taken in fisheries (Lofoten) and energy systems (Senja). We suggest that these findings might be a symptom of a problem across sites: Even if local publics are in favor of green transitions and recognize the challenges of climate change, they don't necessarily see the relevance to their community. This has several implications besides potential foot-dragging, as pilot and demonstration projects struggle to anchor socio-technical measures in communities. On one hand, we suggest that if a project overlooks local community practices or does not adequately engage with the concerns of the local community, ‘Why in my backyard’ ({WIMBY}) can easily turn into ‘Not in my backyard’ ({NIMBY}). On the other hand, we suggest that a way forward is to consider stakeholders or involve local communities in solutions when developing new energy landscapes by focusing on how community futures can be sustained and potentially improved by being pilots of change. Building on our data by tying the spatial and material conditions to practices of change, we draw lessons from practices at a community level and show the potential uneven outcomes that socio-technical experimentation entails, drawing on interviews and participant observation in Lofoten and Senja. The paper concludes by reflecting on the theoretical implications of {WIMBY} and offers some suggestions for enhancing community engagement.},

Moreover, expertise, while being a necessary condition, is not a sufficient condition for epistemic quality and normative legitimacy of energy scenarios given the scope of transitions that energy scenarios entail, which includes substantial societal repercussions. Four reasons will be provided for wide participation when constructing energy scenarios. First, there are several forecasting shortcomings of top-down approaches. Second, to rely solely on expertise provides incomplete conceptualizations of energy and central concepts such as ‘smartness’, in addition to neglecting normative views. Third, increased epistemic quality is an outcome of wide participation. A fourth reason is derived from the argument of inductive risks, stating that thresholds of evidence should reflect the potential outcomes if erroneously corroborating or rejecting a hypothesis. As energy scenarios provide input to decision-making having potentially large societal impact, they ought to be both normatively legitimate as well as of sufficient epistemic quality, components provided by wide participation.},

However, joining these two aspects of complexity is more a “post-normal science” call than an effective practice. Roughly speaking, analytical-systemic approaches focus on the complex-system side, while deliberative approaches deal with the multi-actor side. Our framework for evaluating different alternative actions, called the S2CE, is intended to reconcile the two approaches. It takes as premises: the recognition of plural values, which makes competing actions only weakly comparable; and the existence of irreducible uncertainties, which gives a heuristic status to the future. The framework hybridises an integrated assessment and modelling exercise, with a deliberative multi-criteria evaluation one, and concludes with a reflexive stage. Application to agricultural water management illustrates the strength of this cross-fertilization. First, the use of computer simulations has been found to enrich collective deliberation by helping stakeholders form and transform their value judgments, and by raising critical questions about options that appeared consensual. Second, the deliberative evaluation informed the integrated assessment and modelling by revealing some model limitations, along with the model’s unequal capacity to reflect the claims of different stakeholders.},

In this respect, researchers have recently focused on the technological viability of normative targets (e.g., emissions reduction). Beyond that sufficient condition, experience has shown that missing social acceptance may serve as a severe hurdle to the actual implication. Furthermore, the functional principles of the surrounding political system may prove inconsistent with the scenario's assumptions or implications. As a contribution to scenario methodology, this paper presents an analytic framework with a focus on the German energy transition. Accounting for transparency, social acceptance and political feasibility, future energy scenarios might be inclined to be more mindful of societal limitations. These hurdles may range from subjectively ascribed characteristics of the energy system to political veto-players. While the analytic framework is applied, it is not limited to the four recent energy scenarios published by German public actors. This study's results highlight the need for an advanced scenario construction process, which becomes eminent given that the emphasis is currently moving from if an energy transition is possible to how this goal can be achieved.},

This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the {UK} power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is ‘translated’ into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply–demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key.},

	abstract = {For over forty years energy expectations have been riddled with internal contradictions, and all too often a failure to recognise complexity, the nature and scale of the challenges to be faced, and resultant uncertainty. Key elements of Shell’s “World of Internal Contradictions” scenario, issued internally in October 1974, still hold good. Some other elements have since intruded, though they should not have been entirely unsuspected. The paper opens with a summary of the October 1974, risks then anticipated: another regional conflict in the Middle East; further serious threats to energy supplies; and another currency crisis and recession. Changes in social attitudes were thought likely to shift the emphasis from working for high achievement to ‘takers and dreamers’ having a more influential role. There were numerous internal contradictions anticipated in the evolution of this long-term scenario that have been apparent over the past forty years and seem likely to continue. Some fundamentals of the exploitation and use of energy resources were as apparent then as they are now. The future, like the past, seems likely to be riddled with internal contradictions and failure to find satisfactory resolution of important challenges for the human race. But the complexities, uncertainties and time horizons involved suggest modelling is a marginal option compared with other approaches.},

	abstract = {Scenarios are a key instrument to guide decision-making in the face of an uncertain future. In the field of energy, scenarios are often published to inform external stakeholders who are not part of the scenario development. This study explores how researchers, a key stakeholder group in shaping the energy future, use energy scenarios. It analyses the case of Switzerland, where several competing scenarios have been developed in reaction to the governmental decision to phase-out nuclear power. 16 structured in-depth interviews with researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds were conducted. While most interviewees use public energy scenarios, there are two contrasting user types. The first group, labelled divers, primarily uses scenarios as a data source, whereas the other group, the sailors, refers to them as plausible energy futures. We identified different interpretations of scenario content between sailors and divers, which result from the quantitative modelling on which contemporary energy scenarios are based. Due to a lack of guidance from modellers and missing qualitative information, energy scenarios are prone to misconceptions and distortions in their interpretation by external users.},

	abstract = {In energy and transport policy research, the creative process of building narrative storylines allows investigating future structures of the system under analysis, thus interpreting causal relations and interdependencies. Quantitative tools instead model the deterministic structure of the system, thus enhancing the validity of input assumptions and presenting long-term implications of policies. However, the process of integrating narratives and modelling remains an intricate phase for deriving robust policy recommendations. The present paper investigates the iterative and participatory application of driving forces in bridging qualitative and quantitative methods in transport scenarios, presenting the case of the Danish transport sector. Stakeholders generate key driving forces and narratives of transport futures as a collective action. Subsequently, a structured prioritization, translation and quantification of the driving forces and qualitative storylines yields the generation of quantitative scenarios in the energy system model {TIMES}-{DK}. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of our approach, underlining that the use of multiple driving forces is a critical aspect for the creation of coherent storylines. The communication among actors has a central role in the iterative process for increasing mutual enrichment and validation. The existing gap between modelling results and the future evolution of the transport sector can be overcome by reinforcing a constant dialogue, as to both embrace stakeholders’ perspectives, and to secure an impact on transport policy making.},

While models and modelling have been of considerable interest in energy social science research, few studies have brought together approaches from philosophy of science and anthropology to examine energy models both conceptually and in the applied sense. We develop a conceptual approach on epistemological ethics that distinguishes between epistemic values – such as accuracy, simplicity, and adequate representation – and non-epistemic values – such as policy relevance, methodological limitations, and learning – built into energy models. The research question is: how do modellers articulate and negotiate epistemic values and what does this imply for the status of models in scientific practice and policymaking? The empirical part of the article draws from ethnographic fieldwork and interviews amongst 40 energy modellers in university research groups in the {UK} from two complementary arenas: scholars preparing their {PhD} in modelling and scholars working in a large-scale energy modelling project. Our research uses ethnographic methods to complement themes recognised in earlier literatures on modelling, demonstrating what models and modellers know about the energy system and how they come to know it in particular ways.},

Such models, commonly formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs ({MILP}), achieve a good trade-off between model accuracy and computational complexity. However, the latter aspect depends heavily on the number of variables. Hence, problems can become intractable when large spatial or temporal resolutions are considered. In this paper, the focus is placed on the temporal dimension and different representations of it are evaluated. The model is solved for a full year in hourly time-steps, for a set of optimally-selected typical days, and, finally, using a rolling horizon formulation in which the {DES} operation is optimized sequentially. Results show the possibility of decreasing the computational burden by several orders of magnitude without sacrificing the accuracy of the optimization results, by appropriately selecting the parameters of the temporal reduction method.},

Along with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, the national greenhouse gas strategies of industrialized countries involve the total restructuring of their energy systems. In order to archive these climate goals, fitted and customized models are required. For that reason, this paper focuses on national energy system models that incorporate all energy sectors and can support governmental decision making processes. The reviewed models are evaluated in terms of their characteristics, like their underlying methodology, analytical approach, time horizon and transformation path analysis, spatial and temporal resolution, licensing and modeling language. These attributes are set in the context of the region and time in which they were developed in order to identify trends in modeling. Furthermore, the revealed trends are set in the context of current challenges in energy systems modeling. Combining specified research questions and specific greenhouse gas reduction strategies, this paper will help researchers and decision makers find appropriate energy system models.},

Given the complexity, system interdependencies between different alternatives need to be considered. One possibility to support decision makers is to apply Energy System Optimization Models ({ESOMs}). This paper reviews selected {ESOMs} with a high level of modeling detail and thus with high spatial, temporal and contextual resolutions that can be applied to support the decision-making process at municipalities. The main objective is to identify modeling approaches and future challenges to design such systems using several modeling frameworks. First, necessary system elements and interrelations are elaborated based on existing municipal system descriptions. The requirements are included in the derived definition of Integrated Multi-Modal Energy System ({IMMES}). Second, selected {ESOMs} are analyzed in terms of the requirements of the system definition. In doing so, existing fundamental approaches are demonstrated. Third, challenges for new mathematical approaches are provided. This review shows that a few modeling approaches are quite prevalent. Future design of models can be directly based on these practices. Additionally, most of the reviewed {ESOMs} only fulfill certain requirements of {IMMES} with a more complex approach. Concluding, future {ESOMs} need to address six research challenges: integrated view, business modeling, spatial planning, complexity level, temporal resolution and uncertainty analysis.},

Three distinct yet overlapping drivers can explain this shift in paradigm towards open methods: a desire for improved public transparency, the need for genuine scientific reproducibility, and a nascent experiment to see whether open source development methods can improve academic productivity and quality and perhaps also public trust. The associated source code, datasets, and documentation need suitable open licenses to enable their use, modification, and republication. The choice for software is polarized: teams need only consider maximally permissive ({ISC}, {MIT}) or strongly protective ({GPLv}3) licenses. Selection is influenced by whether code adoption or freedom from capture is uppermost and by the implementation language, distribution architecture, and use of third-party components. Permissive data licenses ({CC} {BY} 4.0) are generally favored for datasets to facilitate their recombination and reuse. Official and semi-official energy sector data providers should also prefer permissive licensing for copyrightable material.},

In recent years, there has been an increase in developing open source tools by international research and development organizations. More than half of the open energy modeling (openmod) initiative listed tools are based on the freely available scripting language Python. Previous comparisons of energy and power system modeling tools focused on comparisons such as which tool category (e.g. optimization, simulation) or energy demand (e.g. electricity, cooling, and heating) can be considered. Until now, the assessment of incorporated functions such as unit commitment ({UC}) or optimum power flow ({OPF}) has been ignored. Therefore, this work assesses 31 mostly open source tools based on 81 functions for their maturity. The result shows that available open source tools such as Switch, {TEMOA}, {OSeMOSYS}, and {pyPSA} are mature enough based on a function comparison with commercial or proprietary tools for serious use. Nevertheless, future commercial, as well as open source energy system analysis tools, have to consider more functions such as the impact of ambient air conditions and part-load behavior to allow better assessments of including high shares or renewable energy sources and other flexibility measures in existing and new energy systems.},

In this review, we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been tackled by the current literature, as well as pointing at directions for future research. Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research.},

On the other hand, we check whether the Economic Policy Uncertainty ({EPU}) has had an impact on the cross-asset correlations under different market conditions using the Quantile-on-Quantile ({QQ}) technique. Further, we comparatively compare the hedging potential and diversification performance of these energy sources in a context of uncertainty. Accordingly, we, first, show that the connections among the four markets have time-varying characteristics with positive and negative alternating changes in most periods. Random events might cause ephemeral structural changes in correlations. Second, we identify different ways of hedging specific to the energy assets under consideration that provides an efficient risk management framework. Third, we find that the {EPU} has an asymmetrical and often a positive impact on energy cross-market linkages.

	abstract = {In this paper, robust planning of hybrid photovoltaic/wind/battery storage ({PV}/{WT}/Battery) system is performed in the distribution network to minimize power losses cost, purchasing power cost from the hybrid system as well as purchasing power cost from the upstream network considering uncertainties of network demand and renewable generation using information gap decision theory ({IGDT}) based on risk aversion strategy ({RAS}). The decision variables are considered as the optimal installation location and capacity of the hybrid system components in the network as well as the uncertainty radius of the uncertain parameters, which is determined using the flow direction algorithm ({FDA}), which is inspired by the movement of surface water flow to the pond outlet. The planning problem is implemented with deterministic and robust-based {IGDT} approaches. The proposed methodology is performed on the {IEEE} 33- and 69-bus distribution networks. The deterministic results indicate that the optimal hybrid {PV}/{WT}/Battery system planning in the networks significantly reduces system costs by injecting the optimal renewable power into the network and the battery power reserve management. The better capability of the {FDA} in deterministic planning is confirmed compared to the particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), crow search algorithm ({CSA}), and moth-flame optimizer ({MFO}) in achieving lower system cost. Moreover, in the {IGDT} robust approach, the maximum uncertainty radius of the renewable generation and network load is determined for the different uncertainties budget. The {IGDT} effectiveness is proved compared with deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation ({MCS}) methods. The total cost of the 33-bus network in deterministic, {IGDT}, and {MCS} is obtained at \$ 17978.18, \$ 20996.19, and \$ 26178.02, respectively, and for the 69-bus network are achieved at \$ 16846.26, \$ 20215.39, and \$ 20597.84, respectively. A comparison of the results showed that the {MCS} strongly depends on the defined scenarios, is very time-consuming, and is also not able to provide a level of cost assurance, the deterministic method is not able to determine the effect of uncertainties on system planning, but the {IGDT} can easily determine the cost of the system based on changes in uncertainty parameters. Also, planning based on the {IGDT} has resulted in the achievement of a robust hybrid system against forecasting errors caused by uncertainties.},

This work builds a probabilistic techno-commercial model of a water electrolysis plant coupled to an existing nuclear reactor for base load operations. The objective is to perform discounted cash flow ({DCF}) calculations for levelized nuclear hydrogen production cost under input parameter uncertainty. The probability distributions of inputs are used with the Monte Carlo-Latin Hypercube ({MC}-{LH}) sampling technique to generate 105 input scenarios and corresponding distribution of the levelized or life cycle hydrogen production cost instead of deterministic point values. Based on current techno-economic conditions, the levelized production costs of electrolytic hydrogen using electricity from large water-cooled nuclear reactors are determined to be {US} \$ 12.205 ± 1.342, 8.384 ± 1.148 and 6.385 ± 1.051/kg H2 respectively at rated alkaline water electrolyser capacities of 1.25 {MW}(e), 2.5 {MW}(e) and 5 {MW}(e).

	abstract = {The continuously growing population and urban growth rates are responsible for the sharp rise in energy consumption, which leads to increased {CO}2 emissions and demand-supply imbalances. The power sector is switching to alternative energy sources, including renewable energy resources ({RES}) such as Photovoltaic ({PV}) and wind power ({WP}) and battery energy storage systems ({BESS}), among others, due to an increase in the use of fossil fuels and their shortage. Since the power generation of these resources is uncertain due to climatic fluctuations and the direct integration of these resources into the power grid is very complex due to the issues such as; voltage and frequency regulation, overloading of active transmission lines, and supply-demand disparity, the research on system uncertainties is receiving increasing attention. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the several parameters of uncertainty, approaches for dealing with the uncertainty in battery energy storage ({BES})-based {RES} integrated grid, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Moreover, various analytical and numerical approaches were developed for integrating {RES} and {BESS} into the power grid, including probabilistic methods, possibilistic methods, robust optimization-based techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The comparative analysis of these approaches highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses, providing a valuable resource for researchers and utility planners. Additionally, this review paper identifies several issues and challenges associated with the integration of {RES} and {BESS} into the power grid, such as power quality, economical effect, battery aging effect, and environmental effect. Furthermore, the paper suggests a few future research directions, including the development of novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems, coordination of uncertainty parameters, integration of {BESS} into {RES} and grid, power electronics integration, and environmental factor. Overall, this article's novel contributions include a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty parameters, a comparative analysis of uncertainty modeling approaches, an identification of critical issues and challenges, and the suggestion of future research directions to promote a sustainable and reliable power system. This article will aid in defining the requirements and specifications for novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems. The discussion and analysis will assist researchers and utility planners in selecting a suitable uncertainty modeling approach with significant penetrations of distributed {RESs}, which can lead to achieving a reliable and sustainable power system.},

	abstract = {Flexibility options, such as demand response, energy storage and interconnection, have the potential to reduce variation in electricity prices between different future scenarios, thereby reducing investment risk. Investing in flexibility options can also lower the need for generation capacity. However, there are complex interactions between different flexibility options. In this paper, we investigate the interactions between flexibility and investment risk in electricity markets. In particular, we focus on the investment strategies of risk-averse decision-makers. We employ a large-scale stochastic transmission and generation expansion model of the European electricity system, providing it with uncertain future scenarios based on {ENTSOs}’ Ten-Year Network Development Plan. Using this model, we first investigate the effect of risk aversion on investment decisions. We find that the interplay of parameters leads to (i) more investment in a less emission-intensive energy system if planners are risk averse (hedging against {CO}2 price uncertainty), (ii) constant total installed capacity, regardless of the level of risk aversion (i.e. planners do not hedge against demand and uncertainties when deploying renewable energy sources) and (iii) an allocation of investments that disregards cost differences for load shedding across Europe. Second, we examine the individual effects of three flexibility elements on optimal investment levels at different levels of risk aversion: demand response, investment in additional interconnection capacity and investment in additional energy storage. We show that flexible technologies have a higher value for risk-averse decision-makers, although the effects are nonlinear. Finally, we investigate the interactions between the flexibility elements. We find that risk-averse decision-makers show a strong preference for transmission-grid expansion once flexibility is available at a low cost.},

The findings of unit root tests reveal that all variables are stationary at first integration order, and cointegration test findings confirm the presence of long-run relationships among series. The quantile autoregressive distributive lag ({QARDL}) method findings demonstrate that nuclear energy, geothermal energy, and urbanization statistically correlate with {CO}2 emissions and ecological footprint across all quantiles, indicating that these determinants have contributed to environmental degradation. Whereas agricultural development has a statistically significant and negative influence on the environment, implying that agriculture has a pollution-mitigation impact. Based on these empirical findings, several policy implications are presented to preserve environmental quality to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}) target.},

These models contain parameters whose values can be inaccurate which create errors in model predictions. This reduces the effectiveness of energy management and planning done using these models. This study proposes and demonstrates an algorithm to quantify the impact of parameter errors on greenhouse gas and electric power prediction uncertainty. The proposed algorithm introduces a Polynomial Chaos Expansion as a method for the sensitivity analysis in the domain of greenhouse horticulture. Contrary to commonly used sensitivity analyses, this approach introduces the analysis of higher order interactions into the domain of greenhouse horticultural research. It was found that for both electric power and gas production the {HPS} lamp power rating was the most influential individual parameter. Moreover, this study found that for power demand the uncertainty in parameters relating to the lamp system were far more impactful than those related to the crop or greenhouse structure, with a respective coefficient of variation of 24 \%, 5 \% and 5 \%. This study makes a notable and novel conclusion that for parameters related to the greenhouse structure, larger groups of parameters were responsible for prediction uncertainty through higher order interactions of second to sixth order. These results reinforce the importance of future greenhouse research considering the impact of higher order parameter interactions on prediction uncertainty using the algorithm proposed in this study.},

It features the quantitative uncertainty analysis associated with global sensitivity analysis based on the deterministic optimization model for the system. The implementation of the quantitative uncertainty analysis was demonstrated by a cooperated energy storage system to bridge the intermittent renewable energy and the fluctuating demands in refineries. The critical parameters and their impacts on the total annual cost of the system were analyzed. Results show that the proposed analysis framework and the developed solution strategy are effective in quantitatively evaluating parametric uncertainty of the system. The critical parameters vary dramatically under different penetration ratios of renewable energy, but the hydrogen demand is the dominant parameter in all cases.

This paper reviews the rationale for the use of cost optimization and questions whether cost-optimal scenarios are adequate proxies of the real-world energy transition. Evidence from ex-post modeling shows that cost optimization does not approximate the real-world {UK} electricity system transition in 1990–2014. The deviation in cumulative total system costs from the cost-optimal scenario in 1990–2014 is equal to 9–23\% under various technology, cost, demand, and discount rate assumptions. In fact, cost-optimal scenarios are shown to gloss over a large share of uncertainty that arises due to deviations from cost optimality. Exploration of large numbers of near-optimal scenarios under parametric uncertainty can give indication of the bounds or envelope of predictability of the real-world transition. Concrete suggestions are then made how to improve bottom-up energy system models to better deal with the vast uncertainty around the future energy transition.

	abstract = {Uncertainty introduces significant complexity to the design process of distributed energy systems ({DES}) and introduces the risk of suboptimal decisions when the design is performed deterministically. Therefore, it is important that computational {DES} design models are able to account for the most relevant uncertainty sources when identifying optimal {DES} configurations. In this paper, a model for optimal {DES} design under uncertainty is presented and is formulated as a Two-stage Stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Program. As uncertain parameters, energy carrier prices and emission factors, building heating and electricity demands, and incoming solar radiation patterns are considered and probabilistic scenarios are used to describe their uncertainty. The model seeks to make cost-optimal {DES} design decisions (technology selection and sizing) before these uncertain parameters are known, while it also identifies the optimal operation of the selected {DES} configuration for multiple uncertain scenarios. Moreover, two strategies for emission reduction are employed that set {CO}2 limits either to the system’s average emissions under uncertainty (‘neutral’ strategy) or individually to the system’s emissions for every possible uncertainty outcome to ensure a more robust emission performance (‘aggressive’ strategy). To illustrate the model’s application, the design of a {DES} for a Swiss urban neighbourhood of 10 buildings is investigated. Multiple optimal {DES} configurations are obtained by using the ‘neutral’ and ‘aggressive’ emission reduction strategies and the trade-offs between the systems’ economic and emission performance are analysed. Moreover, the optimal {DES} are contrasted in terms of technology selection and energy consumption shares among fossil fuels, grid electricity and renewable energy. Finally, all model outputs are compared to results obtained from a deterministic design model. The comparison showed that the deterministic model leads to underestimations of the system costs and inaccurate estimates of the system’s {CO}2 emissions. Moreover, the deterministic designs, in many cases, underestimate the renewable energy capacity that is required to meet the imposed {CO}2 limits. These significant differences between the stochastic and the deterministic model results can serve to confirm the shortfalls of deterministic design.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a framework for the robust design of multi-energy systems when limited information on the input data is available. The optimal design of a decentralized system involving renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies is considered by formulating a mixed integer linear program that determines the optimal selection, size, and operation of the system to provide energy to an end user, while minimizing its total annual costs and {CO}2 emissions. Different aspects related to the feasibility and the optimality resulting when operating the multi-energy system on input data different than those used for the design are studied. Input data include weather conditions, energy demands and energy prices. First, considering a single input scenario, we define the resolution required to describe the time profiles of the input data. To do so, we aggregate hourly-resolved yearly time-series through a different number of typical design days, and we define the minimum number of typical design days necessary to obtain feasible and optimal system designs when these are operated on the original input profiles. Next, the uncertainty of weather conditions and energy demands is analyzed. This is described through several scenarios, which are created by combining different climate models, greenhouse gas emissions forecasts and models of buildings. The system configurations obtained with one of these scenarios are evaluated by introducing performance indicators that quantify the robustness and the cost optimality attained when operating the selected design on all other possible scenarios. Furthermore, correlations between performance indicators, structure and size of the system, and relevant characteristics of the input scenarios are identified. Based on this analysis, a robust scenario is defined, which requires information on the average scenario only, and its performance is compared against those of the average and of the worst-case scenarios when used to design a multi-energy system. Several designs are investigated, focusing on the minimization of costs and {CO}2 emissions, showing that the proposed robust scenario allows obtaining a robust and optimal system design through a deterministic optimization problem, hence maintaining the computation complexity at a minimum. Despite the higher robustness and cost optimality, slightly higher {CO}2 emissions are observed than the average and the worst-case scenarios. The proposed method is illustrated by performing the optimal design of a multi-energy system providing electricity and heat to a Swiss urban neighborhood, typical of the city of Zurich.},

	abstract = {The effective design of Distributed Energy Systems ({DES}) is subject to multiple uncertainties related to aspects like the availability of renewable energy, the building energy demands, and the energy carrier prices. Nevertheless, current practices involve the use of deterministic design models, which overlook uncertainty and can lead to suboptimal {DES} configurations that fail to deliver the desired performance. A necessary condition in order to obtain robust {DES} designs against uncertainty is the understanding of uncertainty’s impacts and main drivers. Therefore, this paper presents a novel methodological framework for the investigation of uncertainty in the context of {DES} design, which combines optimisation-based {DES} models and techniques from Uncertainty Analysis ({UA}) and Global Sensitivity Analysis ({GSA}). Moreover, the application of the framework is illustrated with a case study for the optimal {DES} design of a Swiss urban neighbourhood. Embarking from a deterministic {DES} design model, first, all sources of uncertainty are identified and appropriate probabilistic descriptions are assigned to all uncertain model parameters. {UA} is then performed using Monte Carlo ({MC}) simulations to quantify the impacts of uncertainty. Results reveal substantial variations in terms of economic and carbon performance of the optimal {DES}, but also in terms of optimal {DES} configurations. Moreover, the {UA} results indicate that the optimal system costs are mostly higher than the deterministic cost estimates, while the inverse is observed for the case of carbon emissions. Additionally, in many of the {MC} simulations, the resulting optimal {DES} configurations deviate significantly from the deterministically obtained designs, which confirms the risk of suboptimal decisions in deterministic design processes. Moreover, the results of {UA} can function as decision support by identifying the {DES} configurations that are optimal for most realisations of uncertainty. Finally, to identify the uncertain parameters that are mostly responsible for the variation of the economic performance of the {DES}, a two-step {GSA} is launched, combining the Morris method and the variance-based Sobol method. Results of the {GSA} indicate the energy demand patterns and the energy carrier prices as primarily responsible for the variability of the optimal system cost, while parameters like the investment costs and the technical characteristics of the technologies exert only minimal influence. The results of {GSA}, besides offering a better understanding of uncertainty to {DES} designers, also identify the parameters for which additional effort needs to be invested to reduce their uncertainty and, as a result, the uncertainty associated with {DES} design.},

These large-scale problems can be directly decomposed into smaller subproblems, in the absence of time-coupling constraints and variables. However, time-coupling is common in energy systems, e. g. due to (seasonal) energy storage and peak-power prices. To solve time-coupled long-term operational optimization problems, we propose the method {DeLoop} for the Decomposition-based Long-term operational optimization of energy systems with time-coupling. {DeLoop} calculates feasible solutions (upper bounds) by decomposing the operational optimization problem into smaller subproblems. The solutions of these subproblems are recombined to obtain a feasible solution for the original long-term problem. To evaluate the quality of the feasible solutions, {DeLoop} computes lower bounds by linear programming relaxation. {DeLoop} iteratively decreases the number of subproblems and employs the Branch-and-Cut procedure to tighten the bounds. In a case study of an energy system, {DeLoop} converges fast, outperforming a commercial state-of-the-art solver by a factor of 32.},

Here, we investigate a suite of near-optimal effort-sharing scenarios where the European electricity sector is decarbonized between 55\% and 75\% relative to 1990, in line with 2030 ambitions. To this end, we use a brownfield electricity system optimization model in combination with the Modeling All Alternatives methodology. Results show that only very particular effort-sharing schemes are able to reach the theoretical minimum system cost. In most cases, an additional cost of at least 5\% is incurred. Results reveal large inequalities in the efforts required to decarbonize national electricity sectors.},

	abstract = {An optimisation-based decision support methodology is presented for the synthesis of energy supply systems on the conceptual level. Previous work in this field has tended to focus on the generation of the single optimal solution. However, given that mathematical models never perfectly represent the real world and that planners are often not aware of all practical constraints, the mathematically optimal solution usually only approximates the real-world optimum, and thus has only limited significance. The presented approach therefore exploits the near-optimal solution space for more rational synthesis decisions. For this purpose, integer-cut constraints are employed to systematically generate a set of near-optimal solutions alongside the optimal solution. In place of the traditional analysis of the single optimal solution, we analyse the generated solution set to identify common features (the “must-haves”) and differences (the “real choices”) among the good solutions, and features not observed in any of the generated solutions (the “must-avoids”). This approach provides valuable insights into the synthesis problem and opens up a wide range of rational decision options. The proposed concept is applied to three different real-world problems at the industrial, district, and urban scale. For all three test cases, many near-optimal solutions are identified with different equipment configurations but similar objective function values. Thus, a ranking of the identified solutions strictly based on a single objective value is not productive. Instead, we show that the near-optimal solutions analysis supports the decision process to identify a wider basis of system options, which may be consulted upon to reach rational synthesis decisions.},

Our implementation specifically aims to find maximally different global energy system transition pathways and assess the extent of their diversity in the near optimal region. From this we can determine the stability of the results implied by the least cost pathway which in turn allows us to both identify whether there are any consistent insights that emerge across {MGA} iterations while at the same time highlighting that energy systems that are very similar in cost can look very different. It is critical that the results of such an uncertainty analysis are communicated to policy makers to aid in robust decision making. To demonstrate the technique we apply it to two scenarios, a business as usual ({BAU}) case and a climate policy run. For the former we find significant variability in primary energy carrier consumption across the {MGA} iterations which then projects further into the energy system leading to, for example, large differences in the portfolio of fuels used in and emissions from the electricity sector. When imposing a global emissions constraint we find, in general, less variability than the {BAU} case. Consistent insights do emerge with oil use in transport being a robust finding across all {MGA} iterations for both scenarios and, in the mitigation case, the electricity sector is seen to reliably decarbonise before transport and industry as total system cost is permitted to increase. Finally, we compare our implementation of {MGA} to the so-called Hop-Skip-Jump formulation, which also seeks to obtain maximally different solutions, and find that, when applied in the same way, the former identifies more diverse transition pathways than the latter.},

While benefiting from local biomass resources Finnish energy system is deemed to achieve this goal, increasing the share of other intermittent renewables is under development, namely wind power and solar energy. Yet the maximum flexibility of the existing energy system in integration of renewable energy is not investigated, which is an important step before undertaking new renewable energy obligations. This study aims at filling this gap by hourly analysis and comprehensive modeling of the energy system including electricity, heat, and transportation, by employing {EnergyPLAN} tool. Focusing on technical and economic implications, we assess the maximum potential of different {RESs} separately (including bioenergy, hydropower, wind power, solar heating and {PV}, and heat pumps), as well as an optimal mix of different technologies. Furthermore, we propose a new index for assessing the maximum flexibility of energy systems in absorbing variable renewable energy. The results demonstrate that wind energy can be harvested at maximum levels of 18–19\% of annual power demand (approx. 16 {TWh}/a), without major enhancements in the flexibility of energy infrastructure. With today's energy demand, the maximum feasible renewable energy for Finland is around 44–50\% by an optimal mix of different technologies, which promises 35\% reduction in carbon emissions from 2012's level. Moreover, Finnish energy system is flexible to augment the share of renewables in gross electricity consumption up to 69–72\%, at maximum. Higher shares of {RES} calls for lower energy consumption (energy efficiency) and more flexibility in balancing energy supply and consumption (e.g. by energy storage).},

We performed comprehensive diagnostics using six algorithms: the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm ({MOEA}), {MOEA}/D, epsilon-{MOEA}, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm {II} ({NSGAII}), epsilon-{NSGAII}, and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 ({GDE}3) to evaluate their controllability, reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Our results show only the self-adaptive search of the Borg {MOEA} was capable of performing well on this nontrivial benchmarking problem.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a new open source software framework to support bottom-up environmental systems planning under deep uncertainty with a focus on many-objective robust decision making ({MORDM}), called {OpenMORDM}. {OpenMORDM} contains two complementary components: (1) a software application programming interface ({API}) for connecting planning models to computational exploration tools for many-objective optimization and sensitivity-based discovery of critical deeply uncertain factors; and (2) a web-based visualization toolkit for exploring high-dimensional datasets to better understand system trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. We demonstrate the {OpenMORDM} framework on a challenging environmental management test case termed the “lake problem”. The lake problem has been used extensively in the prior environmental decision science literature and, in this study, captures the challenges posed by conflicting economic and environmental objectives, a water quality “tipping point” beyond which the lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple deeply uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of pollution management policies. The {OpenMORDM} software framework enables decision makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios, quantify the trade-offs between alternative strategies in different scenarios, flexibly explore alternative definitions of robustness, and identify key system factors that should be monitored as triggers for future actions or additional planning. The web-based {OpenMORDM} visualization toolkit allows decision makers to easily share and visualize their datasets, with the option for analysts to extend the framework with customized scripts in the R programming language. {OpenMORDM} provides a platform for constructive decision support, allowing analysts and decision makers to interactively discover promising alternatives and potential vulnerabilities while balancing conflicting objectives.},

Specifically, we extend Many Objective Robust Decision Making ({MORDM}), a framework for finding and evaluating planning solutions under multiple objectives, to include techniques from robust optimization. Traditional {MORDM} first optimized a problem under a baseline scenario, then evaluated candidate solutions under an ensemble of uncertain conditions, and finally discovered scenarios under which solutions are vulnerable. In this analysis, we perform multiple multi-objective search trials that directly incorporate these discovered scenarios within the search. Through the analysis, we have created multiple problem formulations to show how methodological choices of severe scenarios affect the resulting candidate planning solutions. We demonstrate the approach through a water planning portfolio example in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.},

It has been developed mainly for model-based decision support. This paper investigates the extent to which {EMA} is a promising approach for future oriented technology analysis ({FTA}). We report on three applications of {EMA}, using different modeling approaches, in three different technical domains. In the first case, {EMA} is combined with System Dynamics ({SD}) to study plausible dynamics for mineral and metal scarcity. The main purpose of this combination of {EMA} and {SD} is to gain insight into what kinds of surprising dynamics can occur given a variety of uncertainties and a basic understanding of the system. In the second case, {EMA} is combined with a hybrid model for airport performance calculations to develop an adaptive strategic plan. This case shows how one can iteratively improve a strategic plan through the identification of plausible external conditions that would cause the plan to perform poorly. In the final case, {EMA} is combined with an agent-based model to study transition dynamics in the electricity sector and identify crucial factors that positively and negatively affect a transition towards more sustainable functioning of the electricity sector. This paper concludes that {EMA} is useful for generating foresights and studying systemic and structural transformations despite the presence of a plethora of uncertainties, and for designing robust policies and plans, which are key activities of {FTA}.},

	abstract = {Assessments of security of electricity supply are of high necessity for decision-makers in politics and industry. Based on scientifically sound and reliable advices, better decisions can be made concerning potential interventions in the energy system. With growing shares of intermittent renewable energy generation, probabilistic methods with high temporal resolution are increasingly important to simulate key indicators of security of electricity supply. However, these simulations are computationally complex and thus very time demanding. For this reason, we propose a two-stage metamodeling approach to reduce computational effort while maintaining high levels of accuracy. In the first step, we represent probability distribution curves of available power plant capacities using sigmoid functions. In the second step, we approximate the relevant regression coefficients. We apply both, linear regression methods and more advanced approaches based on artificial neural networks in this second stage. Our results indicate that computational time can be reduced from {\textasciitilde}10 h to {\textasciitilde}2 min. Further, the accuracy of the linear regression approach is relatively high and does not comprise the interpretation of relevant key indicators for the assessment of security of electricity supply. However, our results also show that no further accuracy gains can be achieved using artificial neural networks, indicating strong linear relationships. Overall, our approach reduces modeling complexity and therefore allows the investigation of a higher number of different scenarios, thus allowing for deepened insights about the future energy system. Based on our results, we can state that rather simple, but tailor-made approximation methods can outperform more sophisticated approaches if the latter are not suitable for the specific use-case. For future research, the application of artificial neural networks to approximate non-linear relationships within the assessment of security of electricity supply is highly recommended.},

(3) The optimal strategy for the above commercial buildings is respectively {FMLR}, {FMLR}, and {FHL}-nst, and the comprehensive performance is negatively related to the coal-to-gas consumption ratio.

	abstract = {In district energy applications, implementation of management strategies is crucial to achieve reductions in primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The development of optimization tools to upgrade the operation of smart energy systems should take into account all the relevant elements of these complex infrastructures. In this paper, a global optimization approach, applied to district heating, cooling and electricity networks interconnected to each other, is proposed. The suggested approach combines the optimization of the production side, useful to understand how it is convenient to produce heat, cold and electricity, with demand-side management for district heating customers. This is reached by using a bi-level optimization structure, exploiting the genetic algorithm and linear programming. A physical model of the district heating network is included in the procedure to accurately reproduce the effects of demand-side management. The tool can be applied to different objective functions. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization is carried out with two different objective functions: the operation cost and the carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that, by choosing an intermediate trade-off among the two goals, it would be possible to have a 12\% reduction in the emissions at the expense of a 25\% increase in the operating cost.},

In this paper, for two typical {DES}, Natural Gas Cooling and Heating Triple Supply System ({CCHP}) and Hybrid Energy Distributed System ({HDES}), multi-objective optimization and evaluation have been carried out. In the optimization phase, for the two systems, a multi-objective mathematical programming ({MOMP}) model was developed to minimize the annual total cost and annual carbon emissions under three different operational strategies (heat load following ({FTL}), electrical load following ({FEL}), and load characteristic matching following ({FCL})). Further, operational strategies were transformed into operational constraints, and models were solved using the augmented ε-constrain method. In the evaluation stage, the reference cost growth rate ({CSR}) and the reference {CO}2 emission reduction rate ({CRR}) evaluation indices were developed, and subsequently for two {DES} systems, comprehensive evaluations were conducted by incorporating with the weight distributed {TOPSIS} multi-objective decision-making method. Moreover, an office building in Nanjing was chosen as the baseline building, and the two {DES} systems were simulated. The results show that, under different operating strategies, {CCHP} has the advantage of lower cost, while the {HDES} has the advantage of the lower {CO}2 emission. Under the proposed {FCL} operation strategy, the maximum environmental benefits can be obtained. Compared to the {FEL} operation strategy, the {CO}2 emissions of {CCHP} and {HDES} have been reduced by approximately 4.2\% and 2.9\%, respectively. Compared to the {FTL} operating strategy, the {CO}2 emissions of {CCHP} and {HDES} have been reduced by approximately 15.2\% and 13.7\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {There is a large amount of parametric uncertainties that might affect long-term energy planning, due to the inherent variability connected to the future. Most of these uncertainties are stochastic, i.e. they cannot be reduced, but can be better characterized. In an attempt to address this issue, studies often explore different alternative scenarios or perform local sensitivity analyses. While acknowledging their importance, it is evident that their traditional scope must be rethought, as those methods cannot consider interactions among parameters and hence might omit parameters that are highly influential. This study aims to explore the whole uncertainty range in order to identify the most critical parameters towards fossil-free energy systems with high integration of wind-based electricity. Denmark is used as a case study of a country with large wind resources, which are increasingly exploited. It pursues three steps: (1) selection of parameters and characterization of their uncertainties, (2) global sensitivity analyses through Morris sampling, and (3) uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo runs using Latin Hypercube sampling. Offshore wind upscaling will depend on technological improvements related to capital costs or efficiencies as well as on the system integration constraints. Hence, increasing deployments of offshore wind would require policies that foster technological learning, while promoting the cost-efficient integration of an increase in participation in the power mix, such as grid transmission expansion. Therefore, methods that deal with the whole uncertainty space should, to a larger extent, be implemented when uncertainties are assessed in association with long-term planning of systems with high integration of fluctuating renewable energy.},

Special reference is made to Prof. Szargut's early statement about the need for optimization with ecological concerns. Emphasis is given to optimal synthesis of energy systems, a subject that is still between (or combines) art and science/technology. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that optimization is applied also during the development of models of systems. Hints are given on further considerations and research needs in subjects such as global optimization, as well as optimization with uncertainty, reliability, maintenance and social aspects.

More than 20 years have passed since we wrote this chapter and during this time we gained substantial experience with applying decision analysis to many different government, business, and personal problems. The one lesson that has not changed is that structuring decision problems is the most important and, at the same time, least well understood task of a decision analyst. The three-step structuring process (identifying the problem; selecting an appropriate analytical approach; refining the analysis structure) also has survived the test of time. However, more than 20 years of applying decision analysis have taught us many new lessons, some new tools, and a variety of refinements when it comes to structuring decision problems. We liberally use the text of the 1986 chapter and weave in new materials and ideas as we go along. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009.},

The role of public engagement in processes pertaining to specific transmission line projects is an under-researched, yet important topic that this paper seeks to discuss by investigating how inhabitants perceive these processes and to what extent they find the processes just and fair. This paper addresses the participatory aspects of the planning process, as perceived by the local inhabitants in four Norway and {UK} cases, by using a qualitative comparative case study design. We further analyse this issue through frameworks of public engagement and procedural justice. In both countries public engagement is largely characterized by perceptions of insufficient information, and insufficient influence on the process. In sum, the findings indicate that the informants generally perceive the opportunities for involvement as insufficient and unjust. The findings are quite similar across all cases and both countries. Local inhabitants represent diverse groups who often have different levels of knowledge, time and engagement to bring to the planning process. Their requests for improved processes thus underline the serious public engagement challenges that applicants and decision-makers face.},

	abstract = {Transcribing interviews is one of the most time-consuming and alienating tasks in qualitative research. Some have tried to bypass the problem by hiring external transcribers, which however can be very expensive. Whether due to the time and energy or the financial investment that transcribing requires, researchers therefore often self-impose a limit on the number of interviews that they conduct or even refuse to conduct interviews altogether. To prevent this and help reduce transcription fatigue, some scholars have developed the so-called “listen and repeat” technique. This involves speaking into a microphone what one hears through their headset while a voice recognition software transcribes word by word what it hears. However, this technique has many limitations and still requires a considerable amount of time and effort to be put by the researcher. This article introduces an alternative transcription technique which helps overcome these problems thanks to recent advancements of Artificial Intelligence in the field of voice recognition. Although the drawbacks and unintended consequences of Artificial Intelligence are often highlighted, this article explores its use for interview transcription showing that it can improve drastically the work and life of qualitative researchers. More specifically, this article introduces a transcription technique which allows to generate transcripts fully offline (avoiding in so doing the security concerns that the rising number of cloud-based transcription platforms often raise), rapidly and at little to no cost which one only needs to revise whilst listening to interview recordings, which is why I call this the “listen and revise” technique.},

It offers a brief introduction to the operator notation with two simple examples, followed by the definition of the adjoint operator and the associated adjoint flux. The chapter provides a formal derivation of the general perturbation expression for eigenvalue changes and indicates how the first-order perturbation formulation is obtained. The specific expression for the eigenvalue changes in one-group neutron diffusion theory is also discussed. The chapter examines a few first-order perturbation examples, including the expressions for the differential and integral rod worths, together with interpretations of the adjoint flux. Other applications of adjoint formulations are also discussed such as the adjoint flux for variational formulation, adjoint flux for detector response calculation, and the adjoint formulation for flux perturbation calculation.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis.

	abstract = {The optimal solutions of a multiobjective optimization problem correspond to a nondominated front that is characterized by a tradeoff between objectives. A knee region in this Pareto-optimal front, which is visually a convex bulge in the front, is important to decision makers in practical contexts, as it often constitutes the optimum in tradeoff, i.e. substitution of a given Pareto-optimal solution with another solution on the knee region yields the largest improvement per unit degradation. This paper presents a selection scheme that enables a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm ({MOEA}) to obtain a nondominated set with controllable concentration around existing knee regions of the Pareto front. The preference- based focus is achieved by optimizing a set of linear weighted sums of the original objectives, and control of the extent of the focus is attained by careful selection of the weight set based on a user-specified parameter. The fitness scheme could be easily adopted in any Pareto-based {MOEA} with little additional computational cost. Simulations on various two- and three- objective test problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to guide the population toward existing knee regions on the Pareto front. Comparison with general-purpose Pareto based {MOEA} demonstrates that convergence on the Pareto front is not compromised by imposing the preference-based bias. The performance of the method in terms of an additional performance metric introduced to measure the accuracy of resulting convergence on the desired regions validates the efficacy of the method.},

In late 2016, the {DOE} terminated the process to develop a {CBS} process. To date, little in the public record explores {DOE}'s novel foray into {CBS}. As researchers on {DOE}'s aborted {ECAST} efforts, we situate the novel {pTA} process to create a {CBS} process amidst the technocratic political-historical context of commercial nuclear waste siting in the U.S. Lessons from {ECAST}'s effort highlight persistent institutional barriers inhibiting U.S. capacity to more equitably approach the challenge of siting nuclear waste facilities. We identify the undermining consequences of {DOE}'s focus on expediency; imposed limitations on the scope of {CBS}; bureaucratic obstacles to public input; a lack of continuity in values across executive administrations; and absence of top-level commitment to procedural and institutional learning, innovation, and adaptation. Through our case history and critical reflection, we aim to inform future efforts in the U.S. and beyond to overcome failed technocratic histories and instead steward participatory, equitable, and democratic processes to manage high-level nuclear waste.},

Recent focus has returned to the role of consent to site a deep geologic repository and interim storage facilities. However, what “consent” means has been left quite vague. We report on an empirical investigation using Q method to identify perspectives about how a consent-based siting process should be designed for one or more deep geologic repositories. We recruited twelve individuals deeply engaged with policy and regulatory questions associated with managing nuclear waste in the United States. Results reveal four perspectives: get to yes expediently, seek acceptance by gaining trust, promote inclusion and transparency for informed community choice, and develop legitimacy for the process and outcomes. Each perspective includes features meant to ensure that core concepts of consent are addressed in a process to site one or more deep geologic repositories: self-determination, understanding, and voluntariness. We discuss how perspectives emphasize them in different ways. We also highlight how perspectives reveal preferences for responding to three challenges raised by the socio-political context: what is the scope of the problem to be addressed, how the process can be protected from external pressure, and how to proceed in a context of social distrust. The perspectives suggest many areas of agreement about how a consent-based process should be designed. However, key differences are also revealed which pose a significant challenge for those that will be responsible for designing a process that achieves the promise of consent.},

	abstract = {Supporting Data can be downloaded at: https://gain.inl.gov/content/uploads/4/2024/06/{INL}-{RPT}-24-77048-R1.xlsx Nuclear energy is a critical cornerstone of the current United States clean energy supply and may play a larger role in the future in support of a transition to a net-zero economy. The current fleet of nuclear reactors predominantly consists of large light-water reactors ({LWRs}), while many of the reactor designs under consideration are smaller and/or different technologies. Because these new designs have not yet been built, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with their cost. This complicates energy-planning efforts because cost projections are not always standardized, consistent, and centralized in an easily accessible location. To help support energy planning in the {US}, this report provides advanced nuclear cost ranges using a transparent methodology along with other relevant information that can be used to help support decision making and energy planning. The purpose of this work was to conduct a methodical process for cost evaluation using only public information that was vetted with the end-goal to provide reference cost projections for nuclear energy. To provide a solid basis for these values, the approach and assumptions are explicitly laid out throughout the report allowing any user of the data to challenge or reconsider them. Because future {US} nuclear-reactor costs are still unknown due to little recent observed data, the report opted to compile a comprehensive list of bottom-up estimates and evaluate averages/trends within the data to identify reference ranges. This was deemed preferable to opining on the robustness or validity of one cost estimation versus another. To that end, the work evaluated thousands of lines of cost subaccounts from several bottom-up cost estimates. A wide variety of different reactor types captured in the data are of various sizes and technologies. Some of these reactors will be representative of advanced reactors under development while others will not. Thus, the results here are dependent on the data that are available and the accuracy of the estimates that are used. Each bottom-up estimate was reviewed to determine whether it was complete. Incomplete data sets were corrected to ensure an adequate basis of cross-comparison. The report is not without limitations and should be interpreted as an initial step to develop cost ranges for nuclear technology. Ultimately, future work can build upon the methodology with refined cost estimates to reduce uncertainty. {US}-based overnight capital cost ({OCC}) estimates were compiled from extensive data sets into ranges for both large and small reactor sizes for 2030. To project the cost declines over time, learning rates were sampled from literature sources. No {SMRs} were previously built; hence, learning rates based on bottom-up approaches (e.g., by quantifying the impact stemming from fabrication of different components, modular work, site construction, commissioning) were prioritized. For larger reactors, actual learning rates from deployments were used to project future costs (adjusted to account for standardization or lack thereof between designs). Other costs included are fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs. The final variables were capacity factors and ramp rates to support energy planning.},

The considered ratios are Energy Return on Investment ({EROI}) – standard and external, Energy Payback Time ({EPT}), Primary Energy Factor ({PEF}), and Resource Utilisation Factor ({RUF}). A common energy analysis framework, together with three energy accounting methods based on energy value, exergy, and primary energy, are described. The concept of the time-value for energy as an analogy to the time-value for money is proposed and has a significant impact on the calculated Energy Ratios. In total, this review brings together data for 45 electricity generation projects. Based on the Energy Return on Investment (external), the generation methods fall into three tiers: (1) nuclear, natural gas combined cycle, and geothermal (in New Zealand) with ratios {\textgreater} 30, (2) hydro, wind, and geothermal (in Iceland) with ratios between 5–30, and (3) solar {PV} with ratios less than 5. High Energy Return on Investment ratios correspond to short Energy Payback Times and vice versa. Energy Ratio performance levels for renewable energy generation sources – hydro, wind, geothermal and solar – heavily rely on the quality of the primary natural resource available. This review recommends Energy Return on Investment (external) and Resource Utilisation Factor as the most useful metrics for inclusion in full sustainability assessment.},

	abstract = {Two prominent low-carbon energy resources, wind and sunlight, depend on weather. As the percentage of electricity supply from these sources increases, grid operators will need to employ strategies and technologies, including energy storage, to balance supply with demand. We quantify energy and material resource requirements for currently available energy storage technologies: lithium ion (Li-ion), sodium sulfur ({NaS}) and lead-acid ({PbA}) batteries; vanadium redox ({VRB}) and zinc-bromine ({ZnBr}) flow batteries; and geologic pumped hydroelectric storage ({PHS}) and compressed air energy storage ({CAES}). By introducing new concepts, including energy stored on invested ({ESOI}), we map research avenues that could expedite the development and deployment of grid-scale energy storage. {ESOI} incorporates several storage attributes instead of isolated properties, like efficiency or energy density. Calculations indicate that electrochemical storage technologies will impinge on global energy supplies for scale up — {PHS} and {CAES} are less energy intensive by 100 fold. Using {ESOI} we show that an increase in electrochemical storage cycle life by tenfold would greatly relax energetic constraints for grid-storage and improve cost competitiveness. We find that annual material resource production places tight limits on Li-ion, {VRB} and {PHS} development and loose limits on {NaS} and {CAES}. This analysis indicates that energy storage could provide some grid flexibility but its build up will require decades. Reducing financial cost is not sufficient for creating a scalable energy storage infrastructure. Most importantly, for grid integrated storage, cycle life must be improved to improve the scalability of battery technologies. As a result of the constraints on energy storage described here, increasing grid flexibility as the penetration of renewable power generation increases will require employing several additional techniques including demand-side management, flexible generation from base-load facilities and natural gas firming.},
