# journal-article-template

This repository contains a template for journal
articles published by Elsevier. This template is
based on the paper ``Synergistic Spent Nuclear Fuel
Dynamics Within the European Union" by Bae et al.

# Outline
The `base` directory should contain all TeX files for
the journal article itself.

The `graph-abs` directory holds all files for the
graphical abstract.

The `highlights` directory holds all files for the
3-5 bullet point highlights.

The `letter` directory holds all files for the cover
letter to the journal editor and reviewers.

The `revise` directory holds all files for revision
comments and the corresponding edits. Each new round
of revisions should be covered in a separate TeX
file.

# To compile
Run `make` after making appropriate edits to the
`main.tex` file.
